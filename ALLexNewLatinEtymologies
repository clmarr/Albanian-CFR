Novel proposals: 

torkull/trokull (variant forms, f.) "wooden olive press" (Newmark 1998: 871, 879), with torkull as the etymological form and trokull as 
metathesized, from Latin torculum "olive press, wine press" (REW 8792a, p666). This is thus a doublet of tork "trough used for crushing 
grapes", an analogical singular of a loan from Italian torchio (Orel 1998: 460). 

Peshkëtar "kingfisher" as direct reflex of Latin piscato:rem "fisher", cf. also peshkatar "fisherman, angler" (on defs -- Newmark 1998(: 638)).

Found online but not in scholarly sources (yet?) : 

w ˌɑ l ˈoː r e m , v l ˈɛ ɾ ə $value. TODO cite or propose. Found online but not in scholarly sources? Seems to be absent from Orel 1998 and Bonnet 1998.

t ˈe m p l u m , t ˈɛ m p u lˠ $chapel, temple. TODO cite or propose -- can be found online, but at least does not seem to be in Bonnet 1998's index, nor in Orel 1998...?  

t r ˌɑː d i t ˈoː r e m , t ɾ a ð ə t ˈa ɾ $traitor. Variant: tradhtar. TODO cite, reexamine. Not in Orel 1998, also not in Bonnet 1998.  Can be found online but is it in any scholarly sources? If not TODO add to proposals. 

t r ˌi f ˈo l i u m , t ə ɾ f ˈi l $clover. For definition, but not etymology -- Newmark 1998: 865. Bonnet 1998(: 78, 126) discusses 

tërfojë (< TRIFOLIVM) but not this. Also not in Orel 1998. This definition is online but is it in any scholarly sources? TODO if not, propose. 

s p ˌe r ˈɑ n t i ɑ , ʃ p r ˈɛ s ə $hope. TODO cite or propose -- this etymology can be found online (e.g. here, as from sperans -- 
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sperans#Latin -- see paradigm, would have to be singularized from pl sperantia but cf. inherited Sp. 
esperanza, Ital. speranza, Old Occ esperanssa > Occ. esperança, etc...), but is this in scholarly works? Lack of nasal in Gheg may be 
issue unless it's a loan from Tosk. Orel 1998(:431) instead considers it derived from shp(ë)rej; Bonnet 1998(:304) seems to accept this 
with reservations. Other etymologies (unsourced?) online think it is a native formation.
