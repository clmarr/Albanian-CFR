###merge_lex.py  -- to make gjALex

TODO actually implement... 

TODO fill in usage instrs

for periods -- see PeriodizationPolicy (file)

##Lexica in this folder 

(MSTA = Modern Standard (Tosk) Albanian)

###Single stage lexica

####ALLex = Albanian Latin Lexicon 
	Classical Latin loans in to Classical Proto-Albanian, inherited into MSTA 
	longest running lexicon
	work began in 2022
	
	Exclusions justification : "ExclusionsFromALLex"
			-- may be worth considering for insertions at later layers! 
			
	best to build gjALex off of ALLex though as some work was done in late June onto gjALex 
		but now basing off ALLAPS
	
####APIELex 

Proto-Indo-European etyma inherited into modern Albanian
	
####APBalkLex.txt

from Balkan substrata into tentative common ancestor of Greek, Albanian (Armenian?) 
	
####EPSEALLex 
	loans from Slavic into LPA I 
		
	
###TODO files to check for decisions 

-"etyma to reperiodize.txt"
"ExclusionsFromALLex" 
"Excluded Greek etyma.txt" 

	
###Multistage lexica

####AncientGreekLayer.txt

various layers of Greek to diff stages of Albanian... 

####LatinChristianVocabToAlbanian

organized by time, some certain and less certain cases of borrowings from Latin in era of Christianization and some later periods (e.g. around time of Slavic contact)

consider dividnig on these grounds and then having it feed into the merged lexicon gjALex

####APSlLex.txt
includes etyma from Slavic into LPA I (identical to EPSEALLex as of 9/16) , and into, tentatively, LPA II


####AlbMultiStageLex 

abortive attempt at a manual multi stage lexicon, probably from late 2024 or 2025 


####ALLAPS 
also with intermediate forms worked in
	should use this as a basisǃ 
largely Latin etyma, used in mid 2025, seems to differ from ALLex by 15 -- ID which these are. 
	1. consideration of alternate hypotheses for dating of allegoria > logori
	2. MPA I evigl-aː- > yej, per Lopuhaa 2015
	3. MPA I faʎ-aː > fyej, per Lopuhaa 2015

	8-9. alternative datings for lëvdoj, lavd
	10. pagav-å- > paguaj from Italo-Romance, per Lopuhaa			[this one also into ALLex. ] 
	11. prohib-eː- > pruaj per Meyer apud Lopuhaa		[also into ALLex]
	12. sclawi > shqe "Slav.PL", in addition to shqa
	13. sed-aː-> shuoaj per Lopuhaa 2015 			[also into ALLex]
	14. val-eː- > vyej per Lopuhaa 2015			[also into ALLex]
	15. alt hypoth for miraculum's regular outcome
	(16.??) debitoːritium > detorës 
	17 .strambinu > shtrembër
	?? 
		a copule things not mutually co-addressed, but long story short, should work off ALLAPSǃ
