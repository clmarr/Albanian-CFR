$claimed DORIC per Huld 1986 below
$TODO CHECK GREEK VOICING OF THE  RS IT SEEMS TO CORRELATE TO ALB OUTCOMES!!! 
ˈa ɡ r aː , >* , ˈa ɾ ə $field. Dialectally has long a; Attic agrˈos, Myc a-ko-ro. Per Hamp apud Orel 1998: 7-8. Alternatively, inherited.
ˌa p ˌo l l o n ˈi a , >* , p ɔ j ˈa n $unclear. Huld 1986: 248. Reconsider.
ˌa s p e l l ˈo n , >* , ʃ p ˈɛ l $black poplar. Witczak 2016 claims a Proto-Albanian **ašpella as the source of a Doric *aspell- which become the attested appellón via the known Laconian -sp- > -pp- phenomenon. However, a native -sp- in Albanian becomes f, so (PROPOSAL) it makes more sense as a loan in the reverse. The Doric form could be from some unknown substrate.
b r ˈu k aː , >* , b ɾ ˈu k ə $tamarisk. Doric. Huld 1986(:247) has it from an Ancient Macedonian mīrúkhā; justification unclear. Per Çabej 1986 Etim II(: 332) apud Orel 1998(:38), Doric *brúkā cognate to attested (Attic?) myríkē.  
d r ˈa p a n o n , d ɾ ˈa p ə̃ ɾ̃ ə , d ɾ ˈa p ə ɾ $sickle; pruning hook. Gheg drapën. Huld 1986: 246; Çabej 1961: 250. West Greek/ Doric per Huld. Orel 1998: 72. 
d r ˈi w a s t o n , >* , d ɾ ˈi ʃ t $Drisht, per Huld 1986: 250-1. 
d ˌu s r h ˈa kʰ i o n , >* , d ˈu r ə s  $Durrës. Greek, likely folk etymology, in dus "bad" rhakhia "rocky shores, roaring waves" (Krahe 1964 Vom Illyrischen zum Alteuropäischen : 202). Further possibilities below. 
d ˌy r r ˈa kʰ i u m , >* , d ˈu r ə s $Durrës, per theory of supposed eponymous founding (by Corinthians) based on a Dyrrachius -- Demiraj 2006 The origin of Albanians linguistically investigated -- pp128-9. 
d u r r h ˈa c u m , >* , d ˈu r ə s $Durrës. This is a NOVEL proposal though foreshadowed by Bonnet 1998(:37)'sa remarks about the outcome -s- from what looks like a Latin and Greek /kʰiu-/, rather than the expected /c/ <q>. Italian likewise has Durazzo (< Durratio) rather than expected Duraccio; Slavic Drač. The idea here is that the Latin Durrachium and perhaps the Greek Dyrrhakhium actually overlie a Proto-Albanian /tʃ/ (using this sound as it is what is used in Proto-Albanian as the reflex of PIE *kʷ before i/e by De Vaan 2018 and Orel 2000), rather than a /kiu/ or /kju/, which is plausible as this sound was lacking in both languages. Regarding the accent, once we no longer have the penultimate -I-, then the /u/ becomes antepenultimate, and the stress on it falls out easily from this proposal! Proposed etymology -- compound. Element 1: zero grade of PIE *dʰwœ́r "door" (whence via full grade PAlb dwōrā > døːra > Alb derë "door, pl. dyer). Second element a CPAlb hacum -- from h2ekʷ + yos, h2ekʷ as in h2ekʷ-eh2 whence Latin aqua "water", Lusitanian aqua "river", Protogermanic *awjō. Perhaps also implicit in akull "ice" (ak-ull). Original derivation in h2ekʷ (root of h2ekʷ-eh2) + -yos denominal adjectival stem (cf. a pseudo Latin *aquius). 
ɡ ˌa w s ˈaː f o n , >* , ɡ ə z ˈɔ f $fur, pelt. Orel 1998: 117. May be dialectal/Doric. TODO chronological considerations wrt /s/.

h e l a i w ˈaː n i oː , >* , l ˈy e̯ j $ smear.verb.1sg.pres.act.indic. To smear. from helaiwon "oil" > ... > lyej "smear -- Orel 1998: 236. Determine verb structure. Effected by stress shift later.
i s ˈa m n u m , >* , ˈiː ʃ ə m $Ishëm. Huld 1986: 248; Bonnet 1998: 36. TODO length on the initial i? = heis amnum?? 
k ˌo k k ˈu m a l o n , >* , k ˈu m b u lˠ $plum. Doric, cf Attic kokkumelon; but may be influenced by kungull and brumbull. 
m aː kʰ a n ˈaː , m ˈɔ k ə ɾ̃ ə , m ˈɔ k ə ɾ $millstone. Orel 2000(:23, 102). Doric/ "Northwest Greek" per Huld 1986(: 245-6, 250). Old Tosk mokërë. Gheg mokën. Vatasescu 1997: 346. With stress shift to Albanian accentuation showing archaicness. Explicitly a Doric and not Attic item. 
m ˈaː l o n , >* , m ˈɔ lˠ ə $apple. Vățășescu 1997: 167. Parallel expressions mollat e faqes -- Arom mearile e față. From plural of neuter Doric mālon, the source of Latin malum. De Vaan 2018: 1738; Schumacher & Matzinger 2013: 221 (within which, explicitly Doric). Attributed as a very early Latin loan from mālum by Orel 2000: 31. 
p ˈe p ɔː n a , p j ˈɛ p ə ɾ̃ ə , p j ˈɛ p ə ɾ $sweet melon, cantaloupe, cucumber. OAlb pjepënë. Orel 2000 p25. Gheg: pjepën. Huld 1986(ː246) prefers to have it from an AGk pépwn, as does Topalli . Vățășescu 1997: 176.
