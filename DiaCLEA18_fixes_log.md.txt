Not counting "uninteresting" formatting related changes that were also done to fix the baselines. 

# A. Rule insertion

Rules that were inserted because of missed phenomena or to make other phenomena work. These are effectively proposals. 

## A1 Insertion of phenomena that are quite reminiscent of other phenomena in the baseline cascade. 

## A2 Insertion of phenomena that are something new under the sun from the perspective of the baseline. 

A2.I - l > ʎ / [+hi] __ [+hi],  inserted after the emergence of dark L 
	(which it counterbleeds, and which in DiaCLEA18 occurs much earlier because the posited intermediate long *l: stage is replaced by an immediate of its would-be reflex, dark l, /lˠ/). 

# B Rule relocdation

Rules that were moved to different points in the cascade. 

## B1 -- rule moved to a later time

## B2 -- rule moved to an earlier time 

B2.I - DV1740E3, ln and ll > l, moved to before lambdacism (moved from rule instant 13 to 10), as it seems to feed it. 

B2.II - DV1740F3 -- the lengthening of intervocalic l (and sl > l: (...> lˠ)) before non-front vowels (which is now just straight to darkening, per D3.I) is moved to before DV1740E3 after it was moved forward, as DV1740E3 counterfeeds it. In order to do so, [-front] is now explicitly stipulated in the posterior context. 


# C Changes in conditioning to improve accuracy

Rule input, output, or context conditioning changed. These are done to improve accurcay 

## C1 -- changes in input 

- Gliding rule (R9 in baseline): [-prim] --> [-stres], countertonic vowels are excempted from gliding at this time. 

## C2 -- changes in output 

## C3 -- changes in context conditioning 

## C4 -- changes in both input and output

## C5 -- changes in both input and context conditioning

## C6 -- changes in both output and context conditioning

## C7 -- all three changed. 


# D Rule deletion and cascade simplification

Rules that were deleted, or rather suppressed technically (they were commented out) because there was not much to be gained by keeping them, and/or there was much to be lost. This will also include rule consolidation. 

##D1 -- rules deleted to improve accuracy

D1.I - DV1740G2: intervocalic lambdacism before front vowels
	  it behaved correctly in two cases, and erros in 28
	- of the one it behaved correctly in, it was unnecessary to get the result. 
	- and the remaining correct case, vjej "I need", could have been actually from some sort of *valiere or *valiare rather than the attested valēre for all we know. 

##D2 -- rules deleted as they were redundant

##D3 -- consolidation of multiple rules into single rule. 

D3.I - DV1740F3: original rule was Lat *l > l: / V __ V[-front], now just having this go straight to lˠ as the step of having /lː/ turns out unnecessary, and the conditioning suggests a dark L. 


# E in progress....
