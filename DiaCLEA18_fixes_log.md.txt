Not counting "uninteresting" formatting related changes that were also done to fix the baselines. 

# A. Rule insertion

Rules that were inserted because of missed phenomena or to make other phenomena work. These are effectively proposals. 

## A1 Insertion of phenomena that are quite reminiscent of other phenomena in the baseline cascade. 

A1.I - ?? 

A1.II -- final -n deleted in LPA I. [aka C1A.V, currently doubly marked]

A1.III -- final -ɲ > j in modern standard Albanian except after u. [Unnatural conditioning class!] 

A1.IV -- nw (or nβ) > m before e in Middle Proto-Albanian (MPA I to MPA II), after the passage of Latin /ɪ/ and /eː/ (but not /e/) to /e/. Unspecified for stress (i.e. as [+front,-hi,+tense]), though in fact all effected cases concern countertonic /ˌe/ it seems. This seems to cover all cases of Latin -nv- > Alb. m except for potentially mërrajë, if its etymology in Latin invernālia (> Middle Proto-Albanian *enβˌɛrnˈɑʎɑ) is correct. 

[replace A1.V] {ABROGATED 10/2/25 -- superfluous.} A1.V -- fomerly: temporary gemination of n between stressed high vowel and final ə, in late Proto-Albanian or early Proto-Tosk, blocking rhotacism in these environments (e.g. shpinë, shëllinë, trinë, etc. One exception is rrëshirë it seems. Not internallyː monachus > murg). 

A1.VI -- limited i-mutation of countertonic ˌa in S __ r/l (sarcinārivm > shelqëruor, Salicētvm > Shelqet, salviella > sherbelë). Possibly also k __ r but this is based on one case (carmināre > kernjoj); similarly based on calendārivm > Old Gheg kallënduor alone it may not occur for l, so this is limited to S as prior context. Neverthless, there may be a relation to DV2.2.1C4 which shifts ɛ > a in k/S -- L/R. 

A1.VII -- raising of ɔ to u before a palatoalveolar or palatal then vowel. [LPA I to LPA II]

A1.VIII -- mid front vowels e œ ɛ before r or s then j become i-mutanda, via the ɪ̯. In these cases, the j is then deleted. (scōria > zgjyrë, languōria > lëngjyrë, etc.; miseria > mëshirë, dēsīderia > dëshirë, etc.; ceresia > qerishë > qershi; ecclēsia > kishë, camisia > këmishë...) 

A1.IX -- reduction of u before voiceless stops or clusters containing them. Occurs right after (and is fed by) progressive u-spreading (A2.XXI) 

A1.X - -in Middle Proto-Albanian I, another early vowel loss:  non-initial (i.e. secondary stressed vowel somewhere before) unstressed vowels (including low vowelsǃ) in [+voi] [-voi] __ [+cor,-voi]. This completely usurps [α] ( [-stres,-lo] > ∅ / [+son] t __ k  ) 

A1.XI -- Middle Proto-Albanian lenition. lenition of d and b to delta and beta in between non-nasal non-lateral sonorants. Setting stage for their later loss.  More precisely, posterior context is (r) V -- not directly before j. As of June 27, 2025, however, they are split, with b > β starting earlier. 
	A1.XI.b b > β after any vocoid (not r, unlike ð) and before any (R) V sequence, where R can be a sonorant consonant (unlike for d > ðː including m -- submaritica, including l -- puk, pukë, shullatë; including r -- but these are hardened back to b as also happens to etymological /w/). Feeds A2.XXXXVIII, thus ultimately bleeding prior vowel fronting. Occurs in MPA I; d > ð seems to be a bit later, and may have happened in multiple waves.. 

	A1.XI.d .. d  > ð, post oral sonorant and pre vocoid, settinɡ staɡe for their later loss. As of 6/27/25, decoupled from b to beta. 

A1.XII -- in earlier Middle Proto-Albanian, early loss of vowels in n __ [+cor,-cont] (A1.XII.a -- benedic-o- > bënkoj, christīnatalem > kërshëndelë, paenit-ē/-entia > pendoj and pendesë, reni(d/g)enio > rrëngjej (?); sanit-ātem,-osum > shëndet, shëndosh 
	$  A1.XII.b and of i in [+back] n __ [-cont] [+back] ( communic-ā- > kungoj; manica > mëngë, manic-ā- > mëngoj, manipul-ā- > mbuloj 
 	$ Romanian doesn't do some of these -- communic-ā- , sanitātem, manica... 

A1.XIII (just before MPA I) length lost for /i/ early... just before first instance of beta-coloring. TODO possibly revise? 

A1.XIV hiatus vowels with the first element countertonic has the second element attain length and countertonic stress (primary remains primary though), and the first element reduced to schwa, feeding secondary length later. [ was originally  just before i-mutation and loss of post-labial-continuant j, now in early part of LPA I]

A1.XV early  reduction in # ([-son])* [-delrel,-voi] __ r ([-syl]) [+prim], at latest before regressive initial beta coloring. 

## A2 Insertion of phenomena that are something new under the sun from the perspective of the baseline. 

A2.I - ʎ > l / [+hi] __ [+hi],  inserted after the emergence of dark L and ʎ
	into Middle Proto-Albanian now -- clearly divergent from Vlacho-Romance, inasmuch as that matters. 	

A2.II - j > ∅ disappearance of j after labial continuants, and after pr/br/V-front+round r in MPA. On the basis of qepër and on sherbelë respectively, happens after i-mutation of stressed vowels, and of countertonic a (in limited context). Appears to also happen after final -ja goes to e.  TODO rework this. 

A2.III -- ina > inia rule inserted into Classical Proto-Albanian

A2.IV -- -ˈV ol(-u(m/s),-a(m))  endings see stress shift onto the /o/; this is placed into Latin input handling as it is known to occur widely elsewhere in Romance.

A2.V -- yod deleted after palatals and postalveolars in Late Proto-Albanian.

A2.VI -- final nasal sequences resolve in favor of the first element: scamnum > ... >> shkëmb, stamnum > ... > (Gheg?) shtam, damnum > ... > dëm, pignus > ... > peng, terminum > *tjɛrəmənə > tjermn (cf. A1.I) > ... > qerm, signus (insignē?) > ... > sheng. There seems to be an alternate outcome for mn in -më, and for ŋn in -ɲə (një), but the conditions are unclear except that it only happens after vowels, and this is not implemented for now (exāmen > shemë, flāmen (or flāminem?) > flamë, dignus > denjë...) 

A2.VII -- two rounds of pretonic nasal cluster simplification. Pretonically, nasal sequences resolve to the second element, and at least in the case of /n/, a long variant is what emerges -- sign-āre > shënoj, cognatus > kunat, damn-āre > dënoj, communic-āre > kungoj, carminare > karmini-ā- > kernjoj

A2.VIII -- o and o: > u when unstressed, and before (r) nasal (unstresesd vowel) stop in Ealry Proto-Albanian, largely shared with Vlacho-Romance. Before June 2024, was stipulated as before non-palatal sonorants in pre-penultimate syllables, with some finer grained distinctions, the only which that is retained is the raising before l, in a modified form (A2.VIIIa). Occurs after gliding and the formation of ɲ and ʎ.

A2.VIIIa -- "part 3" of the original A2.VIII, the occurence before /l/, survives as occuring for unstressed o in r/l V-stres

A2.VIIIb -- but A2.VIII does not occur after labial-R/l or n/r onsets. It is sent to ˌɔ in those conditions. 

A2.IX -- Latin pʰ > f inserted into Latin input handling, contrasting with handling of kʰ and tʰ

A2.X -- Middle Proto-Albanian /ɪ/ becomes /i/ instead of /e/ when immediately before ʎ or labials (five cases at present for ˈɪʎ; and 4 for ˈɪp and ˈɪf together; ˈɪ followed by other labials unattested). As of June 20, 2025, also for before /j/ (3 cases) but not ɲ (2 cases). 

A2.XI -- long/tense non-high stressed vowels are rounded under in the influence of round vowels on the other side of ɲ. In the case of ē, this development is blocked by preceding coronals, but proceeds otherwise. As of Jan 28, 2025, expanded to also include the same effect across rj (calendārium > kallënduor, cerasiārium > qershuor... etc.) and across n (iānua > ... > gjua) 

A2.XI.1 -- j deleted in Vrj [round], handling the ˈārjʊ cases but also coctorium > koftor  

A2.XII -- h deleted before non-stressed syllables and after any vowels. 

A2.XIII -- y and ø retract to u and o before n and ɲ (though not m and ŋ) in Middle Proto-Albanian, before the diphthongization of ø and o. 

A2.XIV -- Latin s > z rather than ʃ before m and ɟ (crisma > krezëm, exmulgia > zmojle, scabies > zgjebe, exvigilare > zgjoj, scoria > zgjyrë) but not l (slucus > shluk). Right now generalizing to all non-lateral consonants. 

A2.XV -- Latin onset ex- [eks-] to [es-], seemingly across Romance, so placed into Latin input handling. 
	A2.XV.α -- as of June 10, 2025, broadened: all k in ˌV __ s deleted.

A2.XVI -- j arising due to i-mutation triggers voicing of k at least after s (scabies > zgjebe, scōria > zgjyrë) 

A2.XVII -- right after s goes to ʃ (DV1744.H), it absorbs a following t͡ʃ 

A2.XVIII -- yod is effaced in Middle Proto-Albanian earlier before -a, if after a palatal or palatovelar. Outcomes thus go to -ë and not -a 
	A2.XVIII.* -- however, j is preserved before a tonic vowel after t͡ʃ and d͡ʒ if the prior consonantal is r (arësye, shkarzej, mërzej, kursej). 

A2.XIX -- schwa deleted in hiatus with another vowel, without lengthening, currently placed right before end of Late Proto-Albanian (A2.XX currently placed afterward). 

A2.XX -- quality-identical vowels in hiatus merged, currently to long vowel, currently placed right before end of Late Proto-Albanian. Nasality of second element retained. Maximum stress retained.

A2.XXI -- progressive u-spreading among unstressed syllables (one syllable spread) in Late Proto-Albanian, placed before Late PAlb instantiation of DV1734.1.III syncope, bleeding it; counterbled also by post-nasal voicing so placed before that too. This will also, simultaneously, feed the loss of -a > *ë, by changing  in -V́C*ula- > V́C*ull words, via DV1738, top, part 1. It does so by affecting ANY vowel. See file: "proto-Albanian u spreading"; increased accuracy by 0.4%, improved other words as well. Still need to work out chronology relative to Kul> lk and voiced stop phenomena.

A2.XXII -- TV̯L > ləTV̯ if prior syllable has simple onset, it seems: (duplic-ā- > dulpëkoj, pavīcula > pylkë, radīcula > rilkë, conucula > konurkë, but mātrīcula > ndrikull). Two rules necessary per current DiaSim restriction against features in disjunctions. [-voi] in second row is a dummy/place filler. note that if other /l ə/ sequences arise, the functionality of this could be compromised. 

A2.XXIII -- Middle Proto-Albanian I cluster simplifications done on Jan 29, 2025. 
	A2.XXIII.α -- obstruent lost before continuent then stop ː brōtascu > breshk, potest-ā- > pushtoj, potestātem > pushtet 
			trumpisc-ā- > trushkyej -- feeds pre-fricative nasal lossǃ [this happens later though, actually.]
			also fabrica etc. cases. 

	A2.XXIII.β -- tk# > tək (for now) ː canticus > kantëk ( > kantkë)  -- before ɣ 
				planticus > plang though... hold off on this one. 
			TODO implement? 
	
	 A2.XXIII.ɣ C1 C2 T > C1 T  	-- must be laterǃ -- now placed right before marker for MPA II. 
				(bled by α and β) 
				(bled by loss of n before fricativesǃ 
		R T1 T2 > R T2 ː excarpt-ā- > shkartoj , canticellum > këngjel, 
				culcitra > kultër 
				coēmpt-ā- > qëmtoj , compater > kumtër , computum > kumt 
					con
						nah - co(n)script-ā- > kushtroj (sr > str) 
				ūnctūra > yndyrë , cunct-ā- > kundoj 
		C S1 S2 > C S2 ː capiss-o- > kafshoj 
		S T1  T2 -- ōscit-ā- > ushtoj 
		
		... lupeccātus > lugat 

A2.XXIX Middle Proto-Albanian II -- final schwa insertion in etyma that end up assyllabic and stop-final (doesn't seem to happen effectively to z-, s-, zh-, sh-; unclear: n-/në-)

A2.XXX Middle Proto-Albanian II -- degemination of obstruents. They count as geminates if they share place of articulation and continuancy (so homorganic plosive - affricate is a geminate).

A2.XXXI Middle Proto-Albanian I -- stress retractions...
	A2.XXXI.a in V w ˈVlo (ablēv-ā- > blej , arrīv-ā- > arrij, Drivastum > Drisht, lav-ā- > laj, oli̍̄vānu > ullî, etc. As it turns out 
	A2.XXXI.b V B-strid ˈV-hi R V; bled by w > v taverrë phenom. 
	A2.XXXI.ð stress retraction for coronals - [+syl] [+cor,-nas,-lat] [+prim,-long] [-cont,-voi] ( j ) [+syl] #

A2.XXXII early MPA I -- w deleted after coronal obstruents. Bleeds post-w progressive rounding in this period. 
	
A2.XXXIII -- coalescence of w with following ɪ i or short a in two contexts: T (V-stres) __  and # (Vocoid)* [+son] __

A2.XXXIV -- (TODO write about this!) unstressed long vowels (in practice, mostly countertonic) not reduced to ə by DV2.2.2b.

A2.XXXV -- hiatus j insertion between front vowel __ non-round non-hi vowel in Middle Proto-Albanian I, just before pre-palatal ɪ-raising (which it seems to feed)̠. 

A2.XXXVI --  unstressed front vowels made high if not post-glide. This will (TODO!) ultimately be related to i-mutation by principle. 


A2.XXXVII -- ʎ to jl before unround, jɫ before round if voiced back elements (w, ɡ) are before the prior vowel (evangelium, invigilium, , vilia, Greek gɔ̄leon, galliatia, favalia, eruilium, eriulia, possibly battualia > Cham bëtalë... feeds later darkening but must be before w loses its backness.). counterbled by progressive beta/w coloring. i-mutatory effects but NOT blocked by prior labial (in fact, targets it in the case of w). seems to come after later (Christian) vocab added -- see evangelium > ungjill. 

A2.XXXVIII Middle Proto-Albanian I --bleeding regressive coloring [A2.XXXXIII) , w > v between non-mid back vowels and pre-consonantal E. Does not happen for b (harroj, lëroj., tabelë, tryezë < trabeza, trā). If it sees through (n), as proposed on June 20, then it also feeds n-loss and bleeds nw > m phenomenon

A2.XXXVIV -- tentatively into Classical Proto-Albanian -- may need to revise this fact... Unstressed o unrounds before m then unround vowel -- gesture retiming-- (promitt-e/o- > premtoj, nomin-á- > nëmëroj, rōmānu > rëmër, momentum > mënd, glomerāta > grëmëratë.) Going to e for now. 
[-prim,-hi,+round] > [-round,-lab,-back,+front] 

A2.XXXIX -- (MAJOR -- TODO DISCUSS IN DISS! ALSO-- UNNATURAL CLASSǃ) MPA II~III secondary length revision
	A2.XXXIX.a -- length emerges for tonic and countertonic elements followed by an voiced consonantal other than m (b~β,d~ð,g,z,ʒ,r,ɾ,l,lˠ,ʎ ; n, ɲ) and then an unstressed vowel. 
	A2.XXXIX.b -- length due to b/β and ð loss in V __ C (not just V __ V̯ C as above), sometimes with beta coloring in the case of beta.
	A2.XXXIX.c -- length emerges initially for tonic lax mid vowels, and ˌɔ before non-labials. 
	 
A2.XXXX -- non-primary oː loses length. Bled by A2.XXXVIV.

A2.XXXXI - ø > œ before it is unrounded by LPA. 

A2.XXXXII  d > r / [-prim] __ r  (retained after stress: scodra, chersydra, quadrum)

A2.XXXXIII regressive beta-coloring for initial or soon-to-be initial front vowels before [+lab,-son,+voi] ([-cons] ) [+voi,-syl]. Soon to be initial -- seeing through (([-son]) [-son] (([-cons] ) r )) . Maybe move after vowel falls to make this a simpler rule (or move them before)

A2.XXXXIV s > h in [+lo] (W) -- tatoj < tasit-o-, before -st- cluster would be formed by early syncope. klytyrë, nosom > nae

A2.XXXXV -- right before MPA II, j deleted in various places
	A2.XXXXV.a j > ∅ / s __ V́ (hence why it doesn't mess with vowel outcome in frashuall, qershor). Could remove posterior context and account for këmishë, qershi, and kishë as loans specifically into MPA II, but it'd be odd to have qershi as a loan later than qershuar; this would also force V́C >CV́ phenom into MPA II or later. 

	A2.XXXV.b PHONEMOGENESIS -- earliest case of c formed of k j > c / s __ V

A2.XXXXVI -- word initial long vowels shortened. Counterfed by D3.X.b2 for pre-non-labial ˌɔ 

A2.XXXXVII -- MPA I insertion of j before tonic low vowel, essentially metathetic though it's hard to write it that way. 
	The way this is written looks janky but it makes sense theoretically.
	The j is the palatal articulation of a reducing pretonic front vowel moving forward, away from a prior labial.
	The j appears after a k lˠ r or n -- that is, consonants that are licit to palatalization
	The prior context can "see through" the more quickly articulated consonantal material
		that is voiceless non-labial non-palatal material i.e. k sk rk 
		and lenis/singleton sonorants (exc. we don't code lenis at this point or ever) lˠ (ɽˠ) l (ɽ) r (ɾ) n (ɾ̃) 
	it is specifically DODGING likely blocking material or hte more slowly articulated voiced stops. Patterning of s/l/r is bc they are alveolar, vs. dental (n, d..) 
	So the complication is only apparent. 

A2.XXXXVIII -- MPA I shortening of long round vowels before continuant consonantal labials (b>β by now, m f ; not p and not w), at latest in time to bleed fronting  (buf, puk, pukë/Pukë, grumbull, grumbulloj, umb). Happens in more closed syllables, which are those not followed by a low vowel, in somewhat of a sign that the gliding of non-low vowels may have begun at this point... 

A2.XXXXIX -- rVr > rVlˠ dissimilation. Counterbled by initial r trilling. 

# B Rule relocdation

Rules that were moved to different points in the cascade. 

## B1 -- rule moved to a later time

B1.I -- Latin nasal-fricative phenomenon moved to after the pre-penultimate o/o: to u raising (A2.VIII). As of June 17, however, reverted. As of June 24, moved to right after new location of dj/tj affrication, which appears to feed this; furthermore, lengthening aspect removed -- thtat was Latin internal; conditioning is now stridents. 

B1.II -- gn, -gn-, nj > n (DV1740.D1, .D2, and .D3) and DV1740.D4 (ng(w)- > ɲ before front) moved to after loss of w following k/g, which is at the time of writing in the later part of Classical Proto-Albanian, but a candidate for being moved later. 

B1.III -- initial w effacement phenomena postdated from the Classical-to-Early-MPA period to the lead up to MPA II. 

B1.IV -- DV1744.C1 and C4 moved to beginning of Middle Proto-Albanian II. Obsolete -- see D3.X -- now interpreted as part of initial lengthening feeding diphthongization. 

B1.V -- post-velar stop w moved to MPA II. 

B1.VI -- initial (w) r trilling moved into MPA I.

## B2 -- rule moved to an earlier time 

B2.I - DV1740E3, ln and ll > l, moved to before lambdacism (moved from rule instant 13 to 10), as it seems to feed it. 

B2.II - DV1740F3 -- the lengthening of intervocalic l (and sl > l: (...> lˠ)) before non-front vowels (which is now just straight to darkening, per D3.I) is moved to before DV1740E3 after it was moved forward, as DV1740E3 counterfeeds it. In order to do so, [-front] is now explicitly stipulated in the posterior context. 

B2.III -- DV4.2M1, M2, N1, N3 -- affrication of dj and tj--  relocdated to before post-nasal stop voicing, because ntj ends up as (n)s, not (n)z -- the affrication appears to bleed the voicing. As of June 11 2024, relocdated yet further earlier, to right between i-mutation and ietation -- dj/tj may behave differently as conditioning for i-mutation, but ietation seems to counterfeed dj/tj affrication (segull, castellam > kështjell not këshsell, daemonem > djemër not zemër, though the last could be a later loan as it is Christian terminology).  If this creates problems, another fix could be to make the j arising from hiatus into to a different element, perhaps a /ʝ/? This is currently placed after (in fact, right after) i-mutation, which may have different conditioning effects of dj/tj vs. inherited tʃ/dʒ (< kw, gw). 

B2.IV moving, from the Middle Proto-Albanian to the Early/Classical Proto-Albanian period, the laxing of short non-low vowels (ɒː < PPAlb ā still counting as low) replaced by a lax/tense distinction. Although this is shared with Romance and (for front vowels at least) with, De Vaan 2018(:1736) places it after this point by placing at after ("1.") the fronting of long back vowels and ("3.") the raising of ɒː < PPAlb ā, neither of which being shared wiht Romanian, and the third of which having evidence of non-occurence in Romanian ("duck" -- Alb. rosë vs. Romanian rață, also Alb. modhull : Rom. mazăre...) 

B2.V -- l (> lː) > lˠ moved to before lambdacism (for (l)lj segments)

B2.VI -- (n l >) l l > l moved to before lambdacism

B2.VII -- now regressive i-mutation aka Vj diphthong coalescence happens before progressive i-mutation. 

B2.VIII -- (reformulated) DV2.1.F2 və (or rather vo-) > u phenomena moved back to before end of Late Proto-Alb. It is shared, after all. 

B2.IX -- Tosk uo > ua reinterpreted as including wo > wa (but not etymological vo-), now occurs at beginning of Proto-Tosk. 

## B3 -- possible relocdations to pre-Latin to post-Latin periods out of deletions to test (TODO!) 

B3.I -- D1.I - DV1740G2: intervocalic lambdacism before front vowels 

B3.II -- D1.II -- DV1740F2: l coalescence with nearby resonant to dark L, see also B4.I

## B4 -- possible relocdations from post-Latin to later post-Latin periods out of deletions to test 

B4.I -- D1.II -- DV1740F2: l coalescence with nearby resonant to dark L, see also B3.II 


# C Changes in conditioning to improve accuracy

Rule input, output, or context conditioning changed. These are done to improve accuracy 

## C1 -- changes in input 

### C1A -- input made broader

C1A.I -- prosthesis of w- before initial ō now broadened to also occur before initial short ǒ. Now obsolete, see D3.X

C1A.II -- DV3.1B2 degemination/shortening of nː (nn) to n is broadened to other long nasal consonants as may be necessary.

C1A.III -- deletion of final -s after unstressed vowel in Early Proto-Albanian broadened to include other obstruent coronals, thus hitting the 3SG final -t. 

C1A.IV -- rn > rː becomes unconditioned. 

C1A.V -- final -n also deleted with final -m for DV1738, top, part 1. 

C1A.VI -- DV3.1B2 nː > n broadened so that all long nasals are shortened. 

C1A.VII -- Tosk uo > ua now also understood to include vo > va 
### C1B -- input made narrower

C1B.I - Gliding rule (R9 in baseline): [-prim] --> [-stres], countertonic vowels are excempted from gliding at this time. 

C1B.II -- DV1740F3 -- now only applies to r l 

C1B.III -- DV2.2.2c -- first reduction (and then loss) of internal posttonic vowels now does not occur for low vowels... yet. 

C1B.IV -- DV1736.G1 / DV2.2.1L1 -- ō does actually go to ø, not *uo, before word-final r if it comes after a continuant (mësherë, herë, vlerë, tmerr...)

C1B.V -- DV2.2.1B4 -- ʎ does not trigger i-mutation. It is clear it does not for ˈa (but still does for ˈe, at least ˈe from Latin short ǐ) -- cf. alium > aj, fallium > faj, malleus > maj, pallia >pajë, tālea > tajë, rōsālia > rrëshajë. It also does not trigger i-mutation for ˈu it seems, at least based on vitulea > Middle Proto-Albanian *βetˈuʎɑ > ftujë. There don't seem to be any examples of /ˈɛʎ/ or /ˈoʎ/ at this time. There are various cases where it does appear on the surface to do so for /e/ but all of these are for former [ɪ], like scintīlia > shkëndijë etc, and these may show a different patterning than i-mutation (familia > fëmijë, suavilla > shijë), so this is better handled by a separate rule it seems. 

C1B.VI -- concerns DV4.1U2 (= DV1742P2)-- the  voicing assimilation of ʃ before voiced consonants to modern /ʒ/  now only happens before obstruents. In reality this may be morphological though, as it only seems to happen to the prefix sh- "dis, un" 

C1B.VII -- ɔ > œ phenomena no longer a regular part of i-mutation; relevant cases seem to be actually due to prior yod (georgius > Gjergj, ratiōnem > ratiónem > arësye) or analogical (2/3SG of shoh in sheh). 

C1B.VIII -- (concerns DV2.2.2b)  pretonic non-initial vowel loss changed to not automatically apply to back COUNTERTONIC vowels (u ɔ ɑ)̠. Further specification will probably be necessary. Details on "round pretonics analaysis jan 2025"). Caused rise in accuracy from 19.7% to 21.59%! (Jan 13, 2025) 

C1B.IX -- repeat of DV2.2.2b near end of Old North Tosk Albanian changes now doesn't apply for low vowels (Latin-origin /ɑ/ is now /a/, meaning the restriction against back vowels in C1b.VIII above no longer applies). This will stick around to be applied to possible Slavic (etc.) loans. Further specification for where countertonic vowel loss DOES occur may be necessary. 

C1B.X -- specifications on the specific environments in which w is actually lost, rather than just intervocalically: 
     C1B.X.i -- final ʊ (can just say final round) -- olīvus > ulli, sclavum > shqa 
     C1B.X.ii -- after o -- noverca > njerkë, ovatia > v-oesë 

C1B.XI -- w- prosthesis before o doesn't happen if there is a labial after it. Now obsolete -- see D3.X -- now interpreted as part of initial lengthening feeding diphthongization.

C1B.XII -- falling sonority diphthong coalescence no longer effects ej. 

C1.B.XIII -- long vowels are not reduced; initial vowels are not reduced before glides (massive change! TODO discuss in diss!) TODO finish implementing.

C1.B.XIV -- ɛ no longer deleted word finally for DV1738 top part 1 rule. 

## C2 -- changes in output 

C2.I dj and tj mergin into dʒ tʃ, which as of late June 2024 has been relocdated significantly earlier, now does not immediately result in yod effacement, because the yod can still color following vowels (ratiōne > arësye, curti-ā- > kurtjɔɲœ > kursej, meridi-āre > MPA mɛrdjɔ́ɲœ > mërzej -- unlike with s (pʰaseolus > fasjɔ́lˠu > fashuall) 

C2.II non-low final vowels first to ə, in time to allow Tosk-rhotacism in V̯nV̯# but not many cases of V́nV̯#.   Then final non-low vowels are lost at last. 

## C3 -- changes in context conditioning. Many things that should be in this section are in C1 though because "input" may have been interpreted broadly...

### C3A -- context made broader 

C3A.1 -- the first wave of syncope between n and stops (DV2.2.2b) extended to all nasals as prior context

C3A.2 -- first wave of syncope after nasals, seen above for DV2.2.2b/C3a.1, broadened to apply between nasals in pretonic position if there is a consonant somewhere beforehand. 

C3A.3 -- (formerly A1.I before April 16) -- first wave of syncope after nasals extended: later Middle Proto-Albanian deletion of schwa in R m __ N 

C3A.4 -- pre-strident nasal loss now impacts all nasals, not just n.

C3A.5 --  round vowel now effects /ʏ/ too

### C3B -- context made narrower

C3B.I -- "preconsonantal" ʃ to t͡ʃ in most recent modern Albanian is now only pre-nasal
	(this fix increased accuracy by a whole 1% alone)

C3B.II -- ai > ē (DV1735~A1&A2) blocked prevocalically. 

C3B.III -- major changeǃ 
i-mutation blocked by prior labial elements
		-- this change alone, not made finer, led to a 1.3% increase in accuracy, at an early stage
		and many of the words it did not fix, it set on the right track. 
			-- though further changes are needed to both the specification and the timing of i-mutation it seems... 
Based on one example, it also doesn't occur word initially, so instead of {[-lab];#} for prior context, we get to use the simpler [-lab].

C3B.IV -- DV1744.J3, k,g > j / __ [-round,-stres] t,  now has the conditioning vowel intermediary vowel is [+front] rather than [-round] (changing outcomes when it is [ə] or [a]), and prior vowel is non-front too. TODO further revisions here will likely overrule this. 

C3B.IV* -- nasal optionality removed. This is to be handled elsewhere. 
	IV** -- now needs to come after too (culcitra> kultër, oscit-ā- > ushtoj..>) 

C3B.V -- raising before s/ʃ turned out to only be accurate when there was also a /j/ in the next syllable. This also meant it could effectively be merged into i-mutation, triggering D2.I.

C3B.VI -- 4.1B3 m > mb before unstressed vowel now limited to occur non-initially and with an /l/ on the other side of the unstressed vowel (grumbulloj, shëmbëlltyrë, (m)bletë) 

C3B.VII -- DV1743.B4 now only operates after non-initial vowels then oral resonants (previously: any context with an oral resonant immediately beforehand.). As of Feb 2, 2025, suppressed. 

C3B.VIII -- first wave of vowel drops reshaped, no longer targeting strictly posttonic elements, and now targeting the following: 
	$ atonic (non-low) vowels in [+son] t __ k 
			$ d excluded as it seems there are secondary -dk- clusters with voicing involved, to yet be resolved.
	$ (β) atonic (non-low) vowels in r  __ [-son,-lab]
	$ non-primary (non-low) vowels in in k/g __ t/k(/d/g) V
	$atonic (non-low) vowels in V b/p/g/k __ [-voi,-lab] 
		$ [ɛ] as of Jan 29, 2025, another one added coming first, on the basis of cluster behavior: 
		$ non-initial (i.e. secondary stressed vowel somewhere before) unstressed vowels (including low vowelsǃ) in [+voi] [-voi] __ [+cor,-voi]. This completely usurps [α]. 

C3B.IX -- lengthening aspect of Latin nasal fricative phenomenon removed -- that's Latin internal. 

C3B.X -- i-mutation now requires other consonants to intervene. First one must be consonantal. 

C3B.XI -- major change, remark in diss. (TODO!). Lengthening of vowels no longer occurs before nasals. Related to C3B.XII (essentially bleeds it, in a way.)
	(TODO may need to also make it happen to non-primary stressed, in some capacity, perhaps not here.) 

C3B.XII -- in Proto-Tosk, it is only short ã that becomes ə̃; long ãː actually reflects as -a- (shpërlaj, etc.).  

C3B.XIV -- Tosk rhotacism doesn't happen after  high vowels. As of 10/2/25, ihncluding this as a context conditioning on this 'reversal' rule [rather than a separate rule ~ ɾ̃ > n / [+hi,+prim] __ [-stres] #]. On inspection it appears there's no evidence it's just penultimates.

## C4 -- changes in both input and output

## C5 -- changes in both input and context conditioning

C5.I -- DV1738 final -o(n), -a(s) > schwa phenomena reformed to hitting any final o ɔ or a 


## C6 -- changes in both output and context conditioning

## C7 -- all three changed. 

## C8 -- changes in rule implementation 

C8.I -- i-mutation now realized via an evanescent preposed j that combines with following vowels and (A2.XVI) voices k after s. 

# D Rule deletion and cascade simplification

Rules that were deleted, or rather suppressed technically (they were commented out) because there was not much to be gained by keeping them, and/or there was much to be lost. This will also include rule consolidation. 

##D1 -- rules deleted to improve accuracy

D1.I - DV1740G2: intervocalic lambdacism before front vowels
	  it behaved correctly in two cases, and erros in 28
	- of the one it behaved correctly in, it was unnecessary to get the result. 
	- and the remaining correct case, vjej "I need", could have been actually from some sort of *valiere or *valiare rather than the attested valēre for all we know. 

D1.II - h-insertion rule deleted.

D1.III -- DV3.1A2, that is the passage of "PAlb β" to m before VN$ is deleted as it was errant more often than not. Some of its ground is instead covered by an inserted rule, A1.IV, at an earlier stage in Middle Proto-Albanian. 

D1.IV -- DV4.1R2 -- final z devoicing deleted. Only example mes < medius may be conditioned by other factors, such as syntax, anyways. 

D1.V -- m > mb in word-final position is suppressed. Too many errors. Consider reinstating with finer grained conditioning. Curiously it seems to be happening to an /a/ that undergoes i-mutation, though the relationship between these phenomena seems ... opaque at best?

##D2 -- rules deleted as they were redundant

D2.I -- it turned out that raising of /e/ before /s~ʃ/ (DV2.2.1A4.II) was only accurate when there was a /j/ in the following syllable, which means what was left of the rule once the context was narrowed to express could be merged into i-mutation.

D2.II -- absorption of w in palatalizing k removed, now redundant given earlier mass -w- loss, and lack of such sequences in any contact languages since MPA.

##D3 -- consolidation of multiple rules into single rule. 

D3.I - DV1740F3: original rule was Lat *l > l: / V __ V[-front], now just having this go straight to lˠ as the step of having /lː/ turns out unnecessary, and the conditioning suggests a dark L. This thus involves the effecive deletion of DV3.1E. 

D3.II -- Kortlandt's early final s-deletion is consolidated with the deletion of final nasals, s and -ns that was originally placed right before the earliest vowel drops that were right before the flag for Middle Proto-Albanian. These are currently placed early in the period, where Kortlandt's shift had been placed. 

D3.III -- early drop of post-tonic vowels moved into the originally second vowel drop wave, but a lot of it is going to be covered in C3B.VIII. 

D3.IV -- coalescence of etymological ui/uj, ai/aj, ei/ej, ɛi/ɛj > y e i i all roped into the resolution of i-mutation. As of Feb 2, 2025, simply removed for now. 

D3.V -- i-mutation resolution combined with (E1.I) includes jɔ > œ (/ ø) and (A1.VIII) ɪ̯œ > y. 

D3.VI -- i-mutation resolution also combined with ja in loans into Middle Proto-Albanian (e.g. christiān-u > kërshter-ë), though not after labials;

D3.VII -- j before final unstressed a becomes iota before loss of yod after labials (A2.II), allowing this, too, to join with i-mutation 

D3.VIII -- medial losses of d and b deleted (d -- DV1745.A4 ; b -- DV1745.A2, DV1745.A3) Reinterpreted as lenition outcomes. 

D3.IX -- DV1743.B4 (Lw > Lb) now considered to be part of betacism. 


D3.X -- various rules concerning initial o- are reinterpreted as part of lengthening....

	D3.X.a -- DV2.1F2, və > u, only happened for two etymological cases, vesc-o/e- > ushqej and evangelium > ungjill. Initial o- > vo-,va- phenomenon is now interpreted as initial lax vowel lengthening. Ungjill will have an explanation in tripthong resolution. Thus, input is now ˌuo̯ > βo; and it happens specifically before consonants (vs. ovatia > Old Gheg voese, Old Tosk vaesë... though I suppose that could be the stress retraction.)

	D3.X.b -- dipthhongizations of ɔ ø/œ ɛ > uo ye ie now seen as result of lengthening. 
		D3.X.b1 For ɛ œ it occurs initially when each is stressed (after ø > œ, for convenience) and before a sonorant (or hiatus, but that counts as sonorant).
		D3.X.b2 initial ˈɔ, and initial ˌɔ, also lengthened more broadly, before non-labials.

	D3.X.c -- diphthongization univerally arises from long lax mid vowels that reached a certain point. Unified rule with V[+hi,aplace] ə, schwa excrescence becomes the second diphthong element. This merges in with etymological schwa. 

	D3.X.d -- in partial agreement with DV2.2.1K and 1737's 5b on diphthongized ietation, ɛː ends up as jɛ except the primary stressed case before (to-become) final ɾ lˠ; to these, I broaden these to include n too. 
		
	D3.X.e -- before Later Proto-Tosk finishes (and the split happens), initial uo- ye- to vɔ-, vɛ-

	D3.X.f -- DV2.1D2 (Tosk uo > ua ) extended to also occur after w. w then merges in parallel in Tosk and Gheg into β. 

D3.XI -- beta sent to w after  vowels, joining fate of w for round vowels intervocalically (deletion)

D3.XII -- ɑw > ɑː incorp'd to ɑj > eː. 

D4 -- other reinterpretations. 


# E rule separation

E1 -- rules broken off of single rules to be treated separately 

E1.I -- i-mutation of /ɔ/ no longer treated as regular ( C1B.VII) since it seems to only occur non-analogically when the /ɔ/ is after an etymological yod. It is now realized as the coalescence of /jɔ/ to /œ/ (or /ø/ if we're using that.). 

E1.II -- i-mutation of /u/, where licit, is now treated separately than other i-mutation, realized in the emergence of /j/ after the /u/, and the later coalescence of /uj/ to /y/. Where it is licit: posterior context is a single non-palatal consonant, and prior Tr- (incl. kryq) or ʒ- (< s-), l-... can just go with coronals for now, with ducem > duq and rudem > rrudhë taken as exceptions. Currently nothing is effected at all (June 20, 2025 

E1.III -- now to two stages of rhotacismː n > ɾ̃, and ɾ̃ > ɾ, with vowel loss and certain cluster developments (notably ɾ̃T > ɾ̃D) happening in-between .

E1.IV -- now two stages of -w- deletion. First just deleted after presonorant round vowels. Later, deleted everywhere, joining fate of β, after first Slavic wave, and some final beta coloring phenomena shared between w and b, both as beta. 

E1.V -- kw gw sequences become kʷ gʷ at beginning of MPA II [E1.V.a] then later deround at its close. 


# F larger changes in progress, with things to consider... 

.... need to (re-?)work out the ordering and specific conditioning of many of the things below. 

-- moving the intervocalic stop drops to somewhere, maybe early Middle Proto-Albanian
	and/or considering cluster simplification alternatives to simple intervocalic stop drops
		this is caught up in the question of when unstressed vowels were lost -- when did those clusters form.

also related to the above ^ -- when did vowel reduction occur relative to i-mutation, and relative to intervocalic stop drops, which has major implications for the timing of i-mutation relative ot intervocalic stop drops
	... and the role of prior labials in potentially blocking i-mutation..

...come back to thisǃ 


there is also some sort of (pretonic?) beta and delta triggered cluster voicing phenomenon that appears to be missed this far, part of other general cluster simplifications that seem to be missed thus far... 

Voicing of pretonic secondary clusters involving a voiced stop(?) (> fricative(?)), and with -w- (> fricative β or v or βʷ)?
	exvigil-āre	> əkswəɡəl-aː	> z-gl-oj > zgjoj

	medicastrum 	> mɛdəkˈastrə	> mëgashtër

	ks. m > ʒ (proximus > prozhëm) 

BAST j > BjAST phenom? (see post labial yod effacement file) 

Other cluster simplifications

vowel coloring by w and b at some point in proto-Albanian, probalby multiplke points -- wi >y phenomena, ibV > uo phenomena. V1wV2 > V1(ː,w) phenomena

revise handling of vowels in hiatus before (or during) vowel reductions and falls. 


a late(?) sr > r phenomenon that is fed by vowel falls -- miserem > mjerë? 
	note that DV3.2I2, the rC, Cr > r rules all use PIE -sr- and -rs- clusters to r... 
		the sr > r might have been this late ? 
			(see also dorë "hand" etc) 

some sort of nasal infix onto consonantal onset of penultimate syllable, originally a prefix? 
	(im-?)pedica > pengë 
	imperatōrem > perënduar
	(in-?)dracōnem > drangue (albeit Tosk dragua) 

nasal cluster simplifications.

nasal place assimilation in Late Proto-Albanian

reorganization of rules seems to be necessary
	(1) there seems to be possible ā and au > u phenomena (perhaps via o, but o > u rules seem to currently be rather early at 20-23 ish) for pretonics (or countertonics)
	... that is colored by either a a o progression, or, with the second a rounded due to anjo phenomena, being colored by that 
		... anjo > onjo is currently around R45 . 

	seems specific to the pretonic position 
		.. and before loss of unstressed vowelsǃ
	... and Romanian seems to have ɨ or ə here at least when it's tonic...

	mancus	> Alb. i, e mangët 	Rom. mânc (adj manc)
	manc-āre  > Alb. mungoj (mëngoj also listed) 
	manica	> Alb mëngë 
	manic-āre > Alb. mëngoj 	Rom a mâneca

	paus-āre > Alb. pushoj			O Rom a pǎsa 
		(Meyer and Kristophson think the Alb here is from Ital. Mihaescu Haarmann are not in agreement. ) 

	par-āre > Alb përoj, puroj 
			mbroj		a apǎra 
	
	sanguisungia > Alb. shushunjë 

	axungai > ushunj̈ë?
