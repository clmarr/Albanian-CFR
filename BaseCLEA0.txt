$Orel 1.4.7.13 on p115 -- ns > ʃ
	$ handled in other cascade as part of Latin input handling due to Latin nasal fricative law -- which was in the 2nd century in Latin -- cf Pope 1934 s359 (as a "very early" phenomenon in Latin), also p73 s156ii; also Allen 1978(:27-31, 55-6). 
	$ unlike what happened in Latin, Orel does not give attribute a lengthening effect on prior vowels to this. 
	$ he gives no conditioning environment. 
n s > ʃ



$ intervocalically and after r, Latin d becomes ð (Orel p105), and this also happens for early Slavic loans (1.4.7.16 on p120), and also to Proto-Albanian *d in these positions (Orel 1.4.2.7); in the latter (Orel p65), Orel attributes this spirantization a date in the 10th to 12th century, and relates it to Greek influence -- so it is a much later phenomenon for him. 
$ this corresponds to a quite different treatment in DV1744.A and .E 
$ Orel's words describing the context are repeatedly "intervocalically and before r", but all examples also have the -dr- sequence surrounded  by vowels as well, so this is the interpretation of what he meant (which is quite consistent with the patterning for West Roman lenition more broadly)

	$ corresponds to DV1744.F and 1744.G
