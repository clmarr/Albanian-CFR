=Antique Proto-Albanian

$$|| Latin Input handling|| 
$  rules following here are not core aspects of De Vaan 2018's proposed rules, 
$	but they are necessary to get the right outcomes,
$	i.e. to prevent errors that are "uninteresting"
$	some are drawn from our knowledge of what was going on within Latin
$	they are certainly subject to inspection and possible critique
$	many are nonetheless clearly assumed by De Vaan 2018 in terms of how he treats the nature of the input to rules he does explicate

$ general rule for De Vaan(:1747) is no change in stress placement: by default, Latin loans have the same stress placement as in Classical Latin, "and the same goes for loanwords from later layers... Slavic, Italian... Greek... Turkish". Exceptions seem to be largely morphologically motivated (see bottom of p1747); De Vaan (1747) agrees with Matzinger 2006 that things are too complicated for Jokl 1923's treatment of PPAlb as having general penultimate accent. 

$ Deaspiration: this may or (more probably) may not have been contemporaneous with the merger of PIE aspirate voiced stops into 
$	simple voiced stops, but clearly Greek loanwords in Romance with aspirate voiceless stops became simple voiceless in/by the 2nd cent CE
$		cf. Pope 1934 p226 s629
$	however inclusion in the Albanian cascade is specifically justified by the treatment of OGr loans into Albanian by De Vaan 2018
$		e.g. De Vaan 2018 p1739 ~ DV1739.A4 -- mokër "millstone" Doric *mākhānā
$ corresponds to Orel 1.4.7.1 
[+sg,-cont] > [-sg]

$ 'y' becomes i, likewise for the long-variant (praebyter > prift, etc.) 
[+front,+syl] > [-round,-lab]

$ Latin(-internal?) NASAL FRICATIVE PHENOMENON : Latin nasals lost before fricatives, making a prior vowel long if there was a prior V. 
	$ an input assumption for DV1735.D4. wrt krushk "in-law" < CONSOCER 
	$ some assert these long V-s would have gone through a stage of nasality for the vowels, but De Vaan does not consider this 
		$ relevant for Albanian outcomes
		$ inquiry into whether occasional Gheg nasality in these places (there are some 20-30 relevant words, at least can 
		$ be systematically handled would be interesting
	$ cf Pope 1934 s359 (as a "very early" phenomenon in Latin), also p73 s156ii; also Allen 1978(:27-31, 55-6). 
	$ different handling in corresponding Orel 1.4.7.13 on p115 in ns > ʃ
	$ this should not be formulated and sequenced so as to be fed by De Vaan 2018's one step passage of his PPAlb *tɕ *dʝ > *θ *ð (as this is not indicated), so that is placed afterward 
[+syl] n > [+long] ∅ / __ [-son,+cont]

$ DIACLEA INSERTION:  Latin -ˈVolV(C)# items shift the stress onto the -o-, even though it is short. This is actually seen in the Romance languages too it seems (Seen in modiolus, filiolus, caveola, capreolus, phaseolus, gladiolus, etc...)   so it is placed into Latin input handling. 
[+prim] o > [-stres] [+prim] / __ l [-stres] ([+cons]) #

$ -- end of Latin input handling --- 

$Latin ae basically always falls in with Latin short e so that is handled early on here -- thus implementing parts of the following: 2.2.1B1, 2.2.1B2  
$ this is not outright stated for 2.2.1A3 (i-mutation on Latin e) but there are no counterexamples, while praebyter > prift may actually be an example. 
$ however this could possibly counterfeed 2.2.1C5 (caelvm > qiell), depending on how it is construed -- however currently it will be bled for that word by the development of L (probably correctly) 
[+lo,βstres,ɣprim] e̯ > ∅ [-tense,βstres,ɣprim]

$per Kortlandt 1987 p220 s4 -- final s is deleted. This has to be after the dissimilations (thi for PIE ancestor of Lat. sūs) but before delabialization ū, Kortlandt argues. De Vaan 2018 doesn't list this rule and asserts that nouns tend to reflect the accusative (which Bonnet 1998 seems to agree with), but this is included at this place (after the first Latin wave) to enable nominative forms in the lexicon as well as other words ending in -s, from Latin, Ancient Greek, and PIE alike. Note that Kortlandt 1987 opposes the view that *s went to *h or to ∅ (via /h/ or otherwise) in any other position (contra Jokl 1937, Meyer 1891, Pedersen 1900 , probably also Orel 2000), which includes retracting his earlier 1986 published view on intervocalic *s reflecting as nothing (but cf. nosom > nahe > na?). Given De Vaan 2018's reference to Kortlandt 1987 as its main source of *s developments (TODO check this in correspondence with De Vaan?), this view is adopted within this cascade, for now at least. (Kortlandt's lexical-etymological views are not adopted unless explicitly endorsed by De Vaan 2017, as with deriving the modern Albanian proximals ky,kjo,këta,këto from Latin ECCVM, also the source of these velar proximal elements across Romance) 
$ ʃ and s both included to allow flexibility in place
$ FOR DIA: combined with final consonant deletions originally at the end of Antique Proto-Albanian to Middle Proto-Albanian changes ("$bandaid implied elsehwere -- strip final s in inflectional endings, and then nasals, in that order

$DV1744.D & DV1744.E1  --*tɕ *dʝ > *θ *ð -- for De Vaan, these happen in one step, without intermediate stages in alveolar or dental affricates. 
$ symbol defs and the IPA don't (most typically) use *tɕ *dʝ, these are expressed with c͡ç and ɟ͡ʝ for reasons discussed above in the formulation for DV4.3G1 & H1 
$ needs to come after the nasal-spirant law above in Latin input handling so as not to feed it. 
$ However, in light of the fact that Proto-Albanian loans reflecting PIE palatovelars reflect as ts dz in Aromanian and various ts s z in Romanian (unlike PAlb ð < PPAlb *d, which reflects with d in Romanian and Aromanian), this is indeed split in two, with the affricate stage first, and the spirantization only after Middle Proto-Albanian (when De Vaan assigns the contact between Proto-Albanian and Proto-Vlach)

$ DIACLEA insertion : in-metathesis or i-insertion in -- -Cina-/-Cinia rule (or -ina- metathesis?

$ TODO does seem to happen after aw > a, so consider either relocdating that earlier into the end of Antique Proto-Albanian, or moving this -- and the relevant vowel drops -- later...
$ results when the /i/ is stressed are unclear -- which is why this is a "maybe metathesis" rule
	$ if it is really metathesis, we should see -ní(jë), with the n possibly going to -r- in Tosk when conditioned. This is possible what we see in porrˈīna > *porrinˈiːa > purri(-a) and maybe its possible variant prijë. But prijë could also be explained as coming from a prinjë, which matches the non-metathesis scenario that seems evident in marruːcˈiːna > mërqinjë, where it seems the original i maintains its stress, rather than switching with the n (along with the insertion of an i before the n). On the other hand columbīna > kullumbrí is a clear case of what looks more like metathesis. Seeing as -injë is a rather common suffix, it's possible merqinjë was analogized, so we are going with the -metathesis scenario for now -- that is (ˈ)ina > in(ˈ)ia, not (ˈ)ina > (ˈ)inia

$$ De Vaan 2018 has the change in vowel length to quality only come after major PPAlb to PAlb developments -- see p1736 -- namely long round vowel fronting, ai > ē, and aː > ɔː. -- will be handled in next stage

$ GLIDING -- gliding of unstressed /i/ and /e/ in hiatus with a following vowel to [j] -- cf. Pope 1934 s220. This is attested early but not trivially early -- it is in the Appendix Probi, as Pope 1934(:s220) notes. De Vaan 2018(:1744) seems to implicate this had occurred 
$ by listing DIĀNA and GAVDIVM as having Latin -dj- and likewise -tj- for PUTEVS, VITIVM, PATIOR, and MARTIVS. However, this needs to 
$ be placed before the fates of intervocalic obstruents are handled, as De Vaan does not seem to treat words    like GAVDIVM as having 
$ intervocalic -d-, for example, and this does clearly bleed his proposed rules for intervocalic /d/ in particular, if we assume its 
$ accuracy. Likewise these must also come before De Vaan 2018(: 1740)'s rules for Latin intervocalic /l/, as they feed the formation 
$ of PAlb *ʎ and *ɲ, and bleed the formation of *l:.  
$ for convenience, and given Pope 1934(:s220), and given that forming a broad rule is trivial here, the same is done for /u/ and /o/. 
	$ inasmuch as Latin orthographic V was used for both, there is perhaps mild support for De Vaan 2018 also having this here, 
		$ as informed by the handling of betacism of V (De Vaan 2018: 1744 -- DV1744.C1)

$part I of DV1736.G1 / DV2.2.1L1 has PPAlb ō and Lat ō, as well as Lat o, ultimately becoming *uo before word-final {ɫ,n,r,j}. For this to happen, they cannot be fronted to ø -- as is about to happen to long oː. At the same time, De Vaan does not list a *ɫ in Proto-Albanian or Proto-Albanian, though its sources are clear, coming from a PAlb *lː (DV1739~3.1E), itself with identifiable Pre-Proto-Albanian and Latin sources (DV1740~3.2F, cf. also -E). Makes sense to gather these as /lː/ for now, for the baseline cascade, before this rule. The *Rl aspect of it seems to come after consonantal reductionsː see De Vaan's listing of Latin PARABOLA > përrallë for DV1740~3.2F2. 
$note that this is not listed for the reflex of PPAlb *ā, which is currently *ɒː, but alas this item *does* get fronted to ø under i-mutation in DV2.2.1B7.
$TODO make sure the relevant rules concerning laterals are all placed before this! -- can remove when that is done. 
$What we need to do here: ensure that the relevant words can pass to *uo, and won't be bled by fronting to *ø, and we do this by effectively merging them into *ɒː, the reflex of PPAlb *ā. Use *lː for ɫ for now. Need to do this to o:, but not to short o. Allow presence of unstressed non-low vowel (which will fall before long), and a possible nasal following it, to express what will become final position, as they might not have fallen yet by this stage.

$ effacement of intervocalic /d/, per De Vaan 2018(: 1745 -- DV1745.A4) 
$	$ He asserts that native Proto-Albanian */d/ had a different fate in the same environment, 
	$	becoming /ð/ only after /d/ in Latin words was effaced, 
	$	with the same also occuring for both native and Latin /d/ in V__r (see De Vaan 2018: 1744)
	$ per p1745, he does explicitly propose that Latin intervocalic /d/ also became [ð] before disappearing, 
	$	but before this happened to native intervocalic /d/, and both in V r __ . 
	$ De Vaan 2018(: 1743) also explicitly asserts these passed trough a stage of *ð. 
$ $ note that this account is rival to Orel 2000(:105)'s view that Latin D shared the fate of Proto-Albanian *d in both V __ V and r __ Vs
$ $ The etyma cited by De Vaan 2018 as evidence for this are counterexplained 
	$ for gjyq, bekoj and jek -- by the view that voiced stops were effaced in secondary clusters caused by the internal vowel loss  
		$ cf. Bonnet 1998(:166) 
	$ and for fe and pre being counterexplained as possible later Angevin loans (Marr 2023)

		$  perhaps also medicastrum > mëgashtër may have had the -d- survive to motivate the voicing via progressive voicing assimilation . 
			$ likewise excaudic-ā- > shkaGoj
	$ there are cases where on the surface these appear to be properly effaced -- though it seems many are where vowel drops should be, in line with the views of Orel 2000 and Bonnet 1998 that the drop of /d/ (as well as /ɡ/ and /b/) is due to the clusters formed with fall of unstressed vowels

$DV1734.1.II -- long vowels that arise through contraction in final position with *-ë and -i, the latter with apparent fronting but while illustrated in provided examples this apparent fronting is not stated as part of the development by De Vaan 2018, because it can be handled anyways by i-mutation. Gheg preserves -aë# and -oë# longer and makes them into vowels in some dialects ([æ], [ø]), so this is placed after the split of Proto-Albanian 
$ this rule is formulated to capture not only non-primary stressed i and ə but also e -- this is simpler and has no issues as far as I'm aware -- TODO examine this for errors if necessary though.

$DV4.1V3 -- lk > jk -- some variation (bujk/ bulk for "peasant", OAlb attests ulk) but seems (??) pan-Albanian in nature? 
$$ dialectal evidence suggests that this originally first passed to ʎ: Huld 1976 p 197 for ujk shows that uʎk- forms in Arvanitika and Arbereshe (Sal, Vacc, Falc), and Huld reasonably asserts proto-Albanian had either or uʎk- or ulk- when it split. This is perfectly compatible with hte rest of De Vaan 2018 (which has ʎ go to j later), and is not a new conclusion, so the version supported by Huld is implemented here for now.
$MOST FAITHFUL VERSION: l > j / __ k
l > ʎ / __ k

$DV4.1E2 & DV4.1F2 -- iotation of l after velar stops. This does not occur in some southern varieties, such as Cham and some Arbereshe dialects, so it could be that it occurred after Proto-Tosk split (in the broad sense, i.e. Proto-Southern-Albanian), or that Proto-Southern-Tosk retracted *ʎ to *l after velar stops. The outcome in Arvanitika is ʎ; in Arvanitika (and the other varieties where ʎ occurs after velars?), ʎ elsewhere appears to be preserved -- cf. Arvanitika biʎë "daughter" noted in De Vaan 2018 (:1740).

$~ Standard Albanian

$following changes only for future dialect handling. -- DV8/9 -- "except for the nj > j in verb forms, none are in the *written standard*", many widely accepted in spoken standard Albanian  

$DV4.1V5 -- ɲ to j "often between vowels and in final position". This is a pretty modern development within northern Tosk, and the variety underlying the standard (as are many Lab dialects? But may need to check that) but in many regional northern Tosk dialects it hasn't happened. Has happened in parts of Gheg? Anyhow it is unclear if De Vaan intends to treat this as a regular sound change. In ALLex there are a number of cases where ɲ survives intervocalically (Danjell, kunjoj, shenjë, gështenjë, linjë, mënjollë, mënjë, mushkonjë, mërqinjë, panjë, rozhponjë, shushunjë, tenjë) and a few it doesn't (incuneāre > ngujoj -- but this might be from ngul instead) 
$ in final position there are two cases where it survives in ALLex : CVNEVM > kunj "spike", VĪCĪNVM > fqinj "neighbor" -- these are both after high vowels, but leave that for the Dia- cascade 
$ the only major place the standard seems to do this is in the 3sg present forms, so this is ignored before the placement of MSAlb but placed as an ongoing change afterward
