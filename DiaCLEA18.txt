$$|| Latin Input handling|| 
$  rules following here are not core aspects of De Vaan 2018's proposed rules, 
$	but they are necessary to get the right outcomes,
$	i.e. to prevent errors that are "uninteresting"
$	some are drawn from our knowledge of what was going on within Latin
$	they are certainly subject to inspection and possible critique
$	many are nonetheless clearly assumed by De Vaan 2018 in terms of how he treats the nature of the input to rules he does explicate

$ general rule for De Vaan(:1747) is no change in stress placement: by default, Latin loans have the same stress placement as in Classical Latin, "and the same goes for loanwords from later layers... Slavic, Italian... Greek... Turkish". Exceptions seem to be largely morphologically motivated (see bottom of p1747); De Vaan (1747) agrees with Matzinger 2006 that things are too complicated for Jokl 1923's treatment of PPAlb as having general penultimate accent. 

$DIACLEA CORRECTION A2.IX: pʰ > f, even if tʰ > t and kʰ > k
	$  Aromanian has shcl'ifur but Romanian has only palanga > pǎrângǎ (like Albanian also has p- in cognat plengë). 
pʰ > f

$ Deaspiration: this may or (more probably) may not have been contemporaneous with the merger of PIE aspirate voiced stops into 
$	simple voiced stops, but clearly Greek loanwords in Romance with aspirate voiceless stops became simple voiceless in/by the 2nd cent CE
$		cf. Pope 1934 p226 s629
$	however inclusion in the Albanian cascade is specifically justified by the treatment of OGr loans into Albanian by De Vaan 2018
$		e.g. De Vaan 2018 p1739 ~ DV1739.A4 -- mokër "millstone" Doric *mākhānā
$ corresponds to Orel 1.4.7.1 
[+sg,-cont] > [-sg]

$ Greek 'y' becomes i, likewise for the long-variant (praebyter > prift, etc... however there may be some exceptions: khylus > Alb. qull vs. Romanian cir. (The case of qipër/qypër, however, is probably secondary, and for hte same reasons as shqip/shqyp -- rounding in some Gheg dialects in (at least) [c] __ [p] ) 
[+front,+syl] > [-round,-lab]

$ g before n is ŋ -- Pope 1934(: p75 s158, p133 s321); Allen 1978 p23; Lloyd 1987 p81)
$ not made explicit by De Vaan -- henceforth Latin ɡn as discussed by him can be assumed to represent ŋn. In Romanian these clusters (later) become mn or m- (agnellus > miel, signum > semn, cognatus > cumnat...), but for Albanian De Vaan later assigns these as going to /ɲ/. 
ɡ > ŋ / __ n

$ Latin(-internal?) NASAL FRICATIVE PHENOMENON : Latin nasals lost before fricatives, making a prior vowel long if there was a prior V. 
	$ an input assumption for DV1735.D4. wrt krushk "in-law" < CONSOCER 
	$ some assert these long V-s would have gone through a stage of nasality for the vowels, but De Vaan does not consider this 
		$ relevant for Albanian outcomes
		$ inquiry into whether occasional Gheg nasality in these places (there are some 20-30 relevant words, at least can be systematically handled would be interesting -- it seems generally they are not nasalized) 
	$ cf Pope 1934 s359 (as a "very early" phenomenon in Latin), also p73 s156ii; also Allen 1978(:27-31, 55-6). 
		$ Shared with Romanian apparently. 
		$ Per Allen, Vaananen etc 
	$ different handling in corresponding Orel 1.4.7.13 on p115 in ns > ʃ
	$ this should not be formulated and sequenced so as to be fed by De Vaan 2018's one step passage of his PPAlb *tɕ *dʝ > *θ *ð, so that is placed afterward  (just because this is not indicated -- if there is evidence for it this would merit a change in treatment)
$DIACLEA CHANGE B1.I: moved this to after the pre-penultimate o/o:>u phenomena. As of June 17 -- reverted, returned to normal position. As of June 24, moved to right after new location of dj/tj affrication, which appears to feed this; furthermore (, lengthening aspect removed -- htat was Latin internal; condition is now stridents.

$ DIACLEA INSERTION: A2.IV. Latin -ˈVolV(C)# items shift the stress onto the -o-, even though it is short. This is actually seen in the Romance languages too it seems (Seen in modiolus, filiolus, caveola, capreolus, phaseolus, gladiolus, etc...)   so it is placed into Latin input handling. 
[+prim] o > [-stres] [+prim] / __ l [-stres] ([+cons]) #

$DIACLEA INSERTION A2.XV: the prefix ex- [eks-] is treated as es-, seemingly across Romance. A2.XV.α -- as of June 10, 2025, broadened: all k in ˌV __ s deleted.
k > ∅ / [+stres,-prim] __ s

$ -- end of Latin input handling --- 

$Latin ae basically always falls in with Latin short e so that is handled early on here -- thus implementing parts of the following: 2.2.1B1, 2.2.1B2  
$ this is not outright stated for 2.2.1A3 (i-mutation on Latin e) but there are no counterexamples, while praebyter > prift may actually be an example. 
$ however this could possibly counterfeed 2.2.1C5 (caelvm > qiell), depending on how it is construed -- however currently it will be bled for that word by the development of L (probably correctly) 
[+lo,βstres,ɣprim] e̯ > ∅ [-tense,βstres,ɣprim]

$per Kortlandt 1987 p220 s4 -- final s is deleted. This has to be after the dissimilations (thi for PIE ancestor of Lat. sūs) but before delabialization of ū, Kortlandt argues. De Vaan 2018 doesn't list this rule and asserts that nouns tend to reflect the accusative (which Bonnet 1998 seems to agree with), but this is included at this place (after the first Latin wave) to enable nominative forms in the lexicon as well as other words ending in -s, from Latin, Ancient Greek, and PIE alike. Note that Kortlandt 1987 opposes the view that *s went to *h or to ∅ (via /h/ or otherwise) in any other position (contra Jokl 1937, Meyer 1891, Pedersen 1900 , probably also Orel 2000), which includes retracting his earlier 1986 published view on intervocalic *s reflecting as nothing (but cf. nosom > nahe > na?). Given De Vaan 2018's reference to Kortlandt 1987 as its main source of *s developments, this view is adopted within this cascade, for now at least. (Kortlandt's lexical-etymological views are not adopted unless explicitly endorsed by De Vaan 2017, as with deriving the modern Albanian proximals ky,kjo,këta,këto from Latin ECCVM, also the source of these velar proximal elements across Romance) 
$ ʃ and s both included to allow flexibility in place
$ FOR DIA: combined with final consonant deletions originally at the end of Classical Proto-Albanian to Middle Proto-Albanian changes ($bandaid implied elsewhere -- strip final s in inflectional endings, and then nasals, in that order)
$ DIACLEA CORRECTION C1A.III -- former s-deletion part of the rule broadened to all obstruent coronals 
$ TODO revise this, probably deleting the first part.

$DV1744.D & DV1744.E1  --*tɕ *dʝ > *θ *ð -- for De Vaan, these happen in one step, without intermediate stages in alveolar or dental affricates. 
$ symbol defs and the IPA don't (most typically) use *tɕ *dʝ, these are expressed with c͡ç and ɟ͡ʝ for reasons discussed above in the formulation for DV4.3G1 & H1 
$ needs to come after the nasal-spirant law in Latin input handling so as not to feed it. 
$ However, in light of the fact that Proto-Albanian loans reflecting PIE palatovelars reflect as ts dz in Aromanian and various ts s z in Romanian (unlike PAlb ð < PPAlb *d, which reflects with d in Romanian and Aromanian), this is indeed split in two, with the affricate stage first, and the spirantization only after Middle Proto-Albanian (when De Vaan assigns the contact between Proto-Albanian and Proto-Vlach)

$ TODO does seem to happen after aw > a, so consider either relocdating that earlier into the end of Classical Proto-Albanian, or moving this -- and the relevant vowel drops -- later...
$ results when the /i/ is stressed are unclear -- which is why this is a "maybe metathesis" rule
	$ if it is really metathesis, we should see -ní(jë), with the n possibly going to -r- in Tosk when conditioned. This is possible what we see in porrˈīna > *porrinˈiːa > purri(-a) and maybe its possible variant prijë. But prijë could also be explained as coming from a prinjë, which matches the non-metathesis scenario that seems evident in marruːcˈiːna > mërqinjë, where it seems the original i maintains its stress, rather than switching with the n (along with the insertion of an i before the n). On the other hand columbīna > kullumbrí is a clear case of what looks more like metathesis. Seeing as -injë is a rather common suffix, it's possible merqinjë was analogized, so we are going with the -metathesis scenario for now -- that is (ˈ)ina > in(ˈ)ia, not (ˈ)ina > (ˈ)inia
	$ inasmuch as ia > e is plausible for Romanian, may also be evident in Romanian and Aromanian (?) -- marrucina > Alb mërqinjë, Romanian mărăcine (albeit also mărăcină), Aromanian mărăține. Alas this rule may not be worth it at all...

$$ De Vaan 2018 has the change in vowel length to quality only come after major PPAlb to PAlb developments -- see p1736 -- namely long round vowel fronting, ai > ē, and aː > ɔː. -- will be handled in next stage

$ GLIDING -- gliding of unstressed /i/ and /e/ in hiatus with a following vowel to [j] -- cf. Pope 1934 s220. This is attested early but not trivially early -- it is in the Appendix Probi, as Pope 1934(:s220) notes. De Vaan 2018(:1744) seems to implicate this had occurred 
$ by listing DIĀNA and GAVDIVM as having Latin -dj- and likewise -tj- for PUTEVS, VITIVM, PATIOR, and MARTIVS. However, this needs to 
$ be placed before the fates of intervocalic obstruents are handled, as De Vaan does not seem to treat words    like GAVDIVM as having 
$ intervocalic -d-, for example, and this does clearly bleed his proposed rules for intervocalic /d/ in particular, if we assume its 
$ accuracy. Likewise these must also come before De Vaan 2018(: 1740)'s rules for Latin intervocalic /l/, as they feed the formation 
$ of PAlb *ʎ and *ɲ, and bleed the formation of *l:.  
$ for convenience, and given Pope 1934(:s220), and given that forming a broad rule is trivial here, the same is done for /u/ and /o/. 
	$ inasmuch as Latin orthographic V was used for both, there is perhaps mild support for De Vaan 2018 also having this here, 
		$ as informed by the handling of betacism of V (De Vaan 2018: 1744 -- DV1744.C1) 
$DIACLEA18 change: changed the -prim to -stress here as this doesn't seem to apply to countertonics as the diagnostics reveal a 0% accuracy over this subset -- especially looking at the cases of gruilla, coopertūra, creāre... etc.

$DIACLEA INSERTION: A2.VIII Latin o and oː alike are changed to short u before non-palatal sonorant consonants, in syllables that are antepenultimate or earlier (i.e. those that will not be final syllables in Late Proto-Albanian)
	$ this seems to be a change shared with Vlacho-Romance. 
	$ originally I thought this was a specifically pretonic development, which does describe the majority of cases, and all cases before /ɫ/ and /ŋ/, but there are exceptions -- fornice > furriq, compater > kumtër, computum > kumt, cˈonsocer > krushk (Romanian cuscru), mˈonachus > murg, cˈontrā > kundër, etc... 
	$ the appearance that it was pretonic is just an artefact of Latin's stress system, that tends to put stress on the penultimate syllable.
	$ this doesn't seem to happen to word-initial vowels; although many of these end up as /u/ (urdhër, urdhëroj, uroj, ullashtër)... it seems there are separate reasons for that. Though the case of ōrdinem is possibly part of this phenomenon. -- cf Meglenite úrdin. 
	$ this occurs before the nasal-fricative phenomena of Latin, which means post-dating that because...
		$ this occurs AFTER the gliding of high vowels in hiatus, as pertains to the syllable counting for what is a valid target for this rule (pistoria > shterë, not shturë or shtyrë, etc)
	$ there are minor differences in the conditioning wrt to the five non-palatal sonorants here... 
		$ 1. for n and m, this also occurs in __ N C, even in penultimate syllables (concha > kungë, rombus > rrumb...) 
		$ 2. This does not happen to long ō before m: prōmitt-ere > premtoj, rōmānus > rëmër. Based on dhuroj < dōnāre, it does seem to occur for ō before n.

Jan 28 2025 -- also realized that +tense was not necessary. 
$ inclusion of ō is unclear -- evidence does not point strongly either way. Excluding it would mean more conditions though.

$ During August 2023 it was thought that ɲ also depalatalized after original ō here but in further consideration, only two items are affected (antōnius, cotōneum) and these were able to be explained otherwise in a much more general rule conditioned by nasals, so this was removed on the 29th

$ the vowel reduction and falls as a whole are said to happen "in the last phase of the Proto-Albanian period... after i-mutation and a-mutation" but it seems this does not apply to these early internal post-tonic reductions given the cited cases of lardh and verdh, nor to the internal pretonic vowels that are reduced to ə and/or "lost at a stage preceding PAlb" (with Latin etyma cited -- cotoneus > ftua, nepōtia > mbesë, etc.); note that APA is not strictly within De Vaan's "PAlb here".

At the same time, De Vaan does not list a *ɫ in Proto-Albanian or Proto-Albanian, though its sources are clear, coming from a PAlb *lː (DV1739~3.1E), itself with identifiable Pre-Proto-Albanian and Latin sources (DV1740~3.2F, cf. also -E).

$ effacements of intervocalic stops and /w/ follow (I'd note they were perhaps all phonetically fricatives at the time they were effaced, cf Pope 1934 on Latin /w/ as [ɣʷ], as noted in BaseCLEF) 

$ effacement of intervocalic /d/, per De Vaan 2018(: 1745 -- DV1745.A4) 
$	$ He asserts that native Proto-Albanian */d/ had a different fate in the same environment, 
	$	becoming /ð/ only after /d/ in Latin words was effaced, 
	$	with the same also occuring for both native and Latin /d/ in V__r (see De Vaan 2018: 1744)
	$ per p1745, he does explicitly propose that Latin intervocalic /d/ also became [ð] before disappearing, 
	$	but before this happened to native intervocalic /d/, and both in V r __ . 
	$ De Vaan 2018(: 1743) also explicitly asserts these passed trough a stage of *ð. 
$ $ note that this account is rival to Orel 2000(:105)'s view that Latin D shared the fate of Proto-Albanian *d in both V __ V and r __ Vs
$ $ The etyma cited by De Vaan 2018 as evidence for this are counterexplained 
	$ for gjyq, bekoj and jek -- by the view that voiced stops were effaced in secondary clusters caused by the internal vowel loss  
		$ cf. Bonnet 1998(:166) 
	$ and for fe and pre being counterexplained as possible later Angevin loans (Marr 2023) 
	$ counterexamples noted by Orel 2000, Bonnet 1998 and Marr 2023 include modh < MODVS, prodhoj < PRŌDĀRE, predhë < PRAEDA, adhuroj/adhëroj < ADŌRĀRE
$ possible other exceptions in the data: 
	$ other cases in the data : kudh (<(IN)CUDEM), kudhër (< INCUDINEM), perhaps predhë, also edh (<HAEDVS) perhaps;
		$  perhaps also medicastrum > mëgashtër may have had the -d- survive to motivate the voicing via progressive voicing assimilation . 
			$ likewise excaudic-ā- > shkaGoj
	$ there are cases where on the surface these appear to be properly effaced -- though it seems many are where vowel drops should be, in line with the views of Orel 2000 and Bonnet 1998 that the drop of /d/ (as well as /ɡ/ and /b/) is due to the clusters formed with fall of unstressed vowels 
	$ However in any case this clearly should be later if it happens at all, because (a) it is not seen in shared vocab with Romanian (padure, etc.), and more importantly (b) it is clear that cases that De Vaan doesn't seem to consider intervocalic -- laridum and viridim -- and which are unaffected (becoming lardh and verdh, respectively) -- thus, intervocalic stop effacement is moved to after vowel this based on DIA evidence, to allow DV1744.E4 to be fed first by internal vowel drops, and to allow them to bleed the -d- effacement after /r/ (and potentially feed it in other cases, if we go with the views of Orel 2000)

	$ the cases of bubalus > buall, diabolus > djall, liber > lirë and perhaps fabrica > farkë suggest that for De Vaan 2018, this should be placed before the loss of unstressed posttonic internal vowels -- unlike the case with /d/ (i.e. laridum > lardh) [though for DIA this has now been moved]

Gheg preserves -aë# and -oë# longer and makes them into vowels in some dialects ([æ], [ø]), so this is placed after the split of Proto-Albanian

$DV4.1V3 -- lk > jk -- some variation (bujk/ bulk for "peasant", OAlb attests ulk) but seems (??) pan-Albanian in nature? 
$$ dialectal evidence suggests that this originally first passed to ʎ: Huld 1976 p 197 for ujk shows that uʎk- forms in Arvanitika and Arbereshe (Sal, Vacc, Falc), and Huld reasonably asserts proto-Albanian had either or uʎk- or ulk- when it split. This is perfectly compatible with hte rest of De Vaan 2018 (which has ʎ go to j later), and is not a new conclusion, so the version supported by Huld is implemented here for now.

l > ʎ / __ k

$DV4.1E2 & DV4.1F2 -- iotation of l after velar stops. This does not occur in some southern varieties, such as Cham and some Arbereshe dialects, so it could be that it occurred after Proto-Tosk split (in the broad sense, i.e. Proto-Southern-Albanian), or that Proto-Southern-Tosk retracted *ʎ to *l after velar stops. The outcome in Arvanitika is ʎ; in Arvanitika (and the other varieties where ʎ occurs after velars?), ʎ elsewhere appears to be preserved -- cf.

$DV3.1H2 : -rn- > -rr- / V __ V . This happens in Gheg and Tosk, but De Vaan 2018, citing Janson 1986(:97f), argues it is post-Slavic. Inasmuch as it happens in Gheg, it is also independent of Tosk rhotacism, and should thus be handled separately.
$DIACLEA CORRECTION C1A.IV -- now unconditioned (formerly  r n > rː / @ __ @)

$DV3.1E -- l: passes to dark l.
$ This is actually pan-Albanian but it is placed as a PAlb to Modern Alb change DV'18.

$ ã raises to ə in Tosk (ultimately denasalizing to ë outside of some Lab subdialects which may (or may not) have preserved nasality, maybe for this item) 
$ DIACLEA CHANGE C3B.XII -- in Proto-Tosk, it is only short ã that becomes ə̃; long ãː actually reflects as -a- (shpërlaj, etc.).

$DV4.1V2 -- ʎ passes to j. This happens across Northern Tosk and most Lab (?) but not in some other isolated southern varieties like Arbereshe. It also seems to have affected all of Gheg but the distribution in Tosk suggests it happened in parallel later, rather than being a true shared development. 
ʎ > j

$DV4.1E / -F -- beginnings late medieval central Albanian palatalization. This effects the reflexes of cl,gl- for all Tosk. Before front vowels, it also affects all of Northern Tosk, as well as Southern Gheg and much of Northern Gheg (more northeastern) but also effects the earlier waves of Turkish loanwords, so this part of it is placed later.

$DV4.1V6 -- *c *ɟ ɲ to j before a consonant ; cf. Schumacher 2013ː 275-6. This is more characteristic of Gheg however it seems so it is suppressed for now; in any case it is not really characteristic of the Tosk-based standard.

$ TODO FOR DIA : consider retracting this just to -o, and have the passage of unstressed -a to -ë only here, as the -o > -ë phenomena in Byzantine/Bulgarian/Italian seem limited to feminines, in which it could be analogical.

$DV4.1E / F -- further palatalization, this time occuring before front vowels -- and affecting Turkish loans as well. This happens in all northern Tosk but that it affected Turkish loans implies a later placement in the relative chronology (in Gheg it dodges some parts of the northwest zone)

$DV4.1K1 -- Old Alb ʃ > t͡ʃ before a consonant 
$DIACLEA ANALYSIS: for Latin loans at present, c [+cons] clusters are barely present (at the pivot point at this rule, only one was detected -- and it was an error), while "ʃ [+cons]" sequences... overwhelmingly don't go to "t͡ʃ ..." 
	$ in fact, as of Aug 15, tʃ for ʃ was the most common confusion, with 88% of errant words having it, and the error was particularly common after the word bound (43.6%), before /t/ (36.8%) and before /k/ (30%) 
	$ DIACLEA correction -- posterior context changed from [+cons] to [+cons,+nas]

c > t͡ʃ / __ [+cons] 

$DV4.1V5 -- ɲ to j "often between vowels and in final position". This is a pretty modern development within northern Tosk, and the variety underlying the standard (as are many Lab dialects? But may need to check that) but in many regional northern Tosk dialects it hasn't happened. Has happened in parts of Gheg? Anyhow it is unclear if De Vaan intends to treat this as a regular sound change. In ALLex there are a number of cases where ɲ survives intervocalically (Danjell, kunjoj, shenjë, gështenjë, linjë, mënjollë, mënjë, mushkonjë, mërqinjë, panjë, rozhponjë, shushunjë, tenjë) and a few it doesn't (incuneāre > ngujoj -- but this might be from ngul instead) 
$ in final position there are two cases where it survives in ALLex : CVNEVM > kunj "spike", VĪCĪNVM > fqinj "neighbor" -- these are both after high vowels, but leave that for the Dia- cascade 
$ DIACLEA insertion -- A1.III -- this DOES occur word finally after i (case of vicinum > fqinj could be analogical based on the plurals)

$DV1742.M2 θ > f with listed Gheg ufull for Tosk uthull (and thjeshtër/fjeshtër < FILIASTER, whatever is made of that) seems transparently more Gheg, and is perhaps not intended to be deterministic and/or needs more fine specification, so currently left unimplemented.
