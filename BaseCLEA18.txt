$ rule to capture movement of native and Greek aː to ɔː -- for benefit of the doubt, borrowing Orel's usage of ɒː to allow this to not to pattern with Latin aː while respecting the chronology of vocalic developments on De Vaan p1736. So here we have aː > ɒː

=Antique Proto-Albanian

$ general rule for De Vaan(:1747) is no change in stress placement: by default, Latin loans have the same stress placement as in Classical Latin, "and the same goes for loanwords from later layers... Slavic, Italian... Greek... Turkish". Exceptions seem to be largely morphologically motivated (see bottom of p1747); De Vaan (1747) agrees with Matzinger 2006 that things are too complicated for Jokl 1923's treatment of PPAlb as having general penultimate accent. 

$ Deaspiration: this may or (more probably) may not have been contemporaneous with the merger of PIE aspirate voiced stops into 
$	simple voiced stops, but clearly Greek loanwords with aspirate voiceless stops became simple voiceless in/by the 2nd cent CE

$$ De Vaan 2018 has the change in vowel length only come after major PPAlb to PAlb developments -- see p1736 -- namely long round vowel fronting, ai > ē, and aː > ɔː. -- will be handled in next stage

$ gliding of unstressed /i/ and /e/ in hiatus with a following vowel to [j] -- cf. Pope 1934 s220. This is attested early but not 
$ trivially early -- it is in the Appendix Probi, as Pope 1934(:s220) notes. De Vaan 2018(:1744) seems to implicate this had occurred 
$ by listing DIĀNA and GAVDIVM as having Latin -dj- and likewise -tj- for PUTEVS, VITIVM, PATIOR, and MARTIVS. However, this needs to 
$ be placed before the fates of intervocalic obstruents are handled, as De Vaan does not seem to treat words like GAVDIVM as having 
$ intervocalic -d-, for example, and this does clearly bleed his proposed rules for intervocalic /d/ in particular, if we assume its 
$ accuracy. Likewise these must also come before De Vaan 2018(: 1740)'s rules for Latin intervocalic /l/, as they feed the formation 
$ of PAlb *ʎ and *ɲ, and bleed the formation of *l:.  
$ for convenience, and given Pope 1934(:s220), and given that forming a broad rule is trivial here, the same is done for /u/ and /o/. 
	$ inasmuch as Latin orthographic V was used for both, there is perhaps mild support for De Vaan 2018 also having this here, 
		$ as informed by the handling of betacism of V (De Vaan 2018: 1744 -- DV1744.C1) 
[-lo,+syl,-prim] > [-syl,+hi] / __ [+syl]

$ effacements of intervocalic stops and /w/ follow (I'd note they were perhaps all phonetically fricatives at the time they were effaced, cf Pope 1934 on Latin /w/ as [ɣʷ], as noted in BaseCLEF) 

$ effacement of intervocalic /d/, per De Vaan 2018(: 1745 -- DV1745.A4) 
$	$ He asserts that native Proto-Albanian */d/ had a different fate in the same environment, 
	$	becoming /ð/ only after /d/ in Latin words was effaced, 
	$	with the same also occuring for both native and Latin /d/ in V__r (see De Vaan 2018: 1744)
	$ per p1745, he does explicitly propose that Latin intervocalic /d/ also became [ð] before disappearing, 
	$	but before this happened to native intervocalic /d/, and both in V __ r. 
	$ De Vaan 2018(: 1743) also explicitly asserts these passed trough a stage of *ð. 
$ $ note that this account is rival to Orel 2000(:105)'s view that Latin D shared the fate of Proto-Albanian *d in both V __ V and V __ r
$ $ The etyma cited by De Vaan 2018 as evidence for this are counterexplained 
	$ for gjyq, bekoj and jek -- by the view that voiced stops were effaced in secondary clusters caused by the internal vowel loss  
		$ cf. Bonnet 1998(:166) 
	$ and for fe and pre being counterexplained as possible later Angevin loans (Marr 2023)

$ post-nasal stop voicing. De Vaan attributes this to Proto-Albanian, for Latin and native words alike for -p- (DV1743.B2, .B4) and -t- (.D2), while treating Latin loans alone for k > g / n __ (DV1744.A1, .A3)
