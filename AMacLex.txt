$claimed MACEDONIAN per Huld 1986 below
b r ˈa d iː , >* , b ɾ ˈɛ ð $savin. Huld 1986: 247. Cf. Romanian brad. Singulativized plural. From a Makedonian *brady cognate to Attic braθy, ult. from Semitic. But maybe instead to PBalkLex -- or inherited from PIE. 
h ˌɔː l ˈe n aː , lˠ ˈã ɾ̃ ə , lˠ ˈə ɾ ə $upper arm, arm; ell. Elbow per Huld. Gheg llânë. Huld 1986(:247) attributes this to this Ancient Macedonian wlénā; Schumacher and Matzinger 2013(:212) instead gives native *alanā, cf Latin ulna, AGk ōlénē (cognate to this proposed AMak). TODO reconsider.
h ˈo r ɡ o n , >* , v ˈa ɾ ɡ $row, chain, ring. Supposed var-g or vjerr-g (Orel 1998: 495; Cabej St. II 267-8...; Demiraj 1997: 408-9); reviving here Mann's proposal (apud Orel 1998: 495) of relation to AGk horkhos, via a "Macedonian" horgos. TODO THIS IS A PROPOSAL. 
m ˌa l ˈa ɡ aː , >* , m ə lˠ ˈa ɡ ə $mallow. Huld 1986 (: 247), as a Makedonian loan; he lists an "FGS mullagë". Though, Huld 1986(:250) lists it as part of the other layer of Greke loans. 
m ˈa r a d r i o n , >* , m a r ˈa j $fennel. Alt. form mërajë. Romanian mărar, marariu. Huld 1986: 247, *maradrio form cognate to Ionic maraθron. maraq may be a doublet or with some influence from Shtokavian morač, or a Vulgar Latin marathrium or marathricum. Effected by later stress shift. 
m ˈa r a tʰ r i a , >* , m ə r ˈa j ə $fennel. Alt. form mërajë of maraj above. Og -on, changed to -a because feminine. 
p ˌa l ˈa m aː , >* , p ə lˠ ˈə m b ə $palm, plot (land). From some West Greek (or Mac?), cf. Doric palámeː. Huld 1986(:247). Cabej St. II 23 apud Orel 1998: 318. Vatasescu 1997ː 37. Apparently Makedonian per Huld 1986. 
$ Huld 1986(:247)s claim of angarî from angareia, despite appeal to Gheg for the first a, does not look like a truly ancient loan given the non-reduction of the medial a and is thus excluded.

$ placenames following same pattern as Makedonian loans to Alb. 
$h ˈa s t i b o n , >* , ʃ t ˈi p $Shtip (city), claimed per Huld 1986(:248) as belonging to this group. Suspicious however (>i outcome, final devoicing...) : inspect [TODO]. Removed. Too suspicious. 
n a iː s s ˈo n , >* , n ˈi ʃ $Nish (city). Per Huld 1986(:248) as ad Naˈïsson < heïs Naïssón. 
r aː ɡ ˈu s s o , >* , r ˈu ʃ $grape; Dubrovnik. From Gk rax, some declension? Or otherwise [and more likely] native, and related to the old name of Dubrovnik, Latin Ragusium, Byz Greek (10th c. Const. Porphyrogen.) Rhaoússin, Rhaoúsa. Italian Ragusa seems to be from Dalmatian Ragusa, not recorded until the 13th c. Buzuku has Rush, could last that as gold form for Old Albanian as it was likely inherited to that point. Cabej 1986 II: 102-3,  Orel 1998: 391: reflects the early Albanian loss of the intervocalic voiced stop before the contraction of vowels. On Ragusa, Bonnet 1998: 166. Also Huld 1986:249 as following Alb-Makedonian accent rules. 
s k ˌa m p ˈi n o n , ʃ k m̩ b ˈĩː , ... $Shkumbin. Regular Tosk form is Shkëmbi. Gheg Shkumbi-ni into standard. Inclusion her per accent rule (TODO (?) assume long i for sanity?) per Huld 1986ː250-1.  
$ Huld 1986(:249)'s claimed inclusion of Vlora as hei̋s Av̋lona excluded, obviously wrong wrt diachr phon
$t ˈo m aː r o n , >* , t ɔ m ˈɔ r $Tomorr. PROPOSAL.-- now considered in Doric lex for now.

Per Neri 2020 in DPEWA (https://www.dpwa.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/dictionary/?lemmaid=14072) from PIE χejɟ-ijeχ-. Old Arbëreshë and Old Gheg dhī.

$ other likely actually native etyma 
m ˌe l ˈe t t ɑ n , m b l ˈɛ t ə , b l ˈɛ t ə $bee, swarm, hive. Orel 2000: 25, 113 as Latin, but currently treating as Greek due to effacement leading to ml > mbl > bl development.. Earlier mbletë. May be native instead esp given religious importance of bees to Albanian folk culture. Source would be melettum, not feminine.
