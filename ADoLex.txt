$claimed DORIC per Huld 1986 below
$TODO CHECK GREEK VOICING OF THE  RS IT SEEMS TO CORRELATE TO ALB OUTCOMES!!! 
$TODO removed -- inherited. ˈa ɣ r aː , >* , ˈa ɾ ə $field. Doric dialectal long a; Attic agrˈos, Myc a-ko-ro. Per Hamp apud Orel 1998: 7-8. Alternatively, inherited. Unsure what to do about the g/ɣ {TODO}
$REJECTED ˌa p ˌo l l o n ˈiː a , >* , p ɔ j ˈa n $Pojan. TOPONYM. unclear. Huld 1986: 248. Reconsider. Rejected in favor of Slavic poljanɪ -- cf. various villages named Poljani in Bosnia, Poljane in Croatia and Slovenia. 
$REJECTED ˌa r d e k s ˈa n t iː , >* , ɛ ɾ z ˈɛ n $Erzen, river in central Albania. TOPONYM. Elsie 2014: 10, Cabej 1986 III: 63. 
ɦ ˌa r ˈe n t o n , >* , ɾ ˈɛ n d $race. Specifically Epirotic apparently per Meyer 1891: 363 supported by Topalli 2017: 1243 and seemingly also Neri 2021 @DPEWA: rend2. Other theories treat it as native though. 
ɦ ˌa s p e l l ˈo n , >* , ʃ p ˈɛ l $black poplar. Witczak 2016 claims a Proto-Albanian **ašpella as the source of a Doric *aspell- which become the attested appellón via the known Laconian -sp- > -pp- phenomenon. However, a native -sp- in Albanian becomes f, so (PROPOSAL) it makes more sense as a loan in the reverse. The Doric form could be from some unknown substrate.
b r ˈu k aː , >* , b ɾ ˈu k ə $tamarisk. Doric. Huld 1986(:247) has it from an Ancient Macedonian mīrúkhā; justification unclear. Per Çabej 1986 Etim II(: 332) apud Orel 1998(:38), Doric *brúkā cognate to attested (Attic?) myríkē.  There is also brúkos, brukós "herald, barbarian, locust" and brūkw -"to bite" > bruk-etós, both known in Doric -- Beekes EDG 244.

$d ˌu s r h ˈa kʰ i o n , >* , d ˈu r ə s  $Durrës. Greek, likely folk etymology, in dus "bad" rhakhia "rocky shores, roaring waves" (Krahe 1964 Vom Illyrischen zum Alteuropäischen : 202). Further possibilities below. REMOVED: Rejected in favor of novel "door-water" hypothesis. 
$d ˌu r r ˈa kʰ i u m , >* , d ˈu r ə s $Durrës, per theory of supposed eponymous founding (by Corinthians) based on a Dyrrachius -- Demiraj 2006 The origin of Albanians linguistically investigated -- pp128-9.  REMOVED: Rejected in favor of novel "door-water" hypothesis. 
d ˌu r r h ˈa c u m , >* , d ˈu r ə s $Durrës. This is a NOVEL proposal though foreshadowed by Bonnet 1998(:37)'sa remarks about the outcome -s- from what looks like a Latin and Greek /kʰiu-/, rather than the expected /c/ <q>. Italian likewise has Durazzo (< Durratio) rather than expected Duraccio; Slavic Drač. The idea here is that the Latin Durrachium and perhaps the Greek Dyrrhakhium actually overlie a Proto-Albanian /tʃ/ (using this sound as it is what is used in Proto-Albanian as the reflex of PIE *kʷ before i/e by De Vaan 2018 and Orel 2000), rather than a /kiu/ or /kju/, which is plausible as this sound was lacking in both languages. Regarding the accent, once we no longer have the penultimate -I-, then the /u/ becomes antepenultimate, and the stress on it falls out easily from this proposal! Proposed etymology -- compound. Element 1: zero grade of PIE *dʰwœ́r "door" (whence via full grade PAlb dwōrā > døːra > Alb derë "door, pl. dyer). Second element a CPAlb hacum -- from h2ekʷ + yos, h2ekʷ as in h2ekʷ-eh2 whence Latin aqua "water", Lusitanian aqua "river", Protogermanic *awjō. Perhaps also implicit in akull "ice" (ak-ull). Original derivation in h2ekʷ (root of h2ekʷ-eh2) + -yos denominal adjectival stem (cf. a pseudo Latin *aquius). For rival hypotheses, see above lines in ADoLex --d ˌu s r h ˈa kʰ i o n "bad shores" etymology per Krahe 1964 Vom Illyrischen zum Alteuropäischen : 202; d ˌu r r ˈa kʰ i u m per eponymous founder Durrachius per Demiraj 2006 The origin of Albanians linguistically investigated -- pp128-9. TODO incorporate into papers.

Beekes EDG 263 -- gausapos, not -phos, "shaggy woolen cloth", notes a "gauðapos" ghost form, kausia "macedonian felt hat", Lat gausapes borrowed from Greek, rejects Greke being borrowed from Assyrian g/kuzippu. 
ɡ ˌɔː l ˈoː n , >* , ɡ ˈɔ lˠ $hole. Orel 1998: 120. Seems not directly related to gojë "mouth" which is attributed to Italian by both Orel and Dashi, nor Romanian gură. Attributed Orel to the citation form AGk ɡ ˌɔː l e ˈo s γωλεός, but this works if it assumes an input effected by the specifically epirotic εo > ου {Filos 2017: 237}.

Beekes EDG 64 as from aleɩ́psɔ̄; aleimma as Ionic-Attic form, derivs used by Diogenes, Hippocrates, attributing this tentatively to PIE *h₂lei̯bʰ- 'ointment' -- which does not predict -ll- or -aː-. Rejected in favor of Byzantine loan.

De Vaan 2018: 1738; Schumacher & Matzinger 2013: 221 (within which, explicitly Doric). Attributed as a very early Latin loan from mālum by Orel 2000: 31. Og -on, changed to -a because feminine.
