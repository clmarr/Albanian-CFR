$ TODO proposal -- Alb aorists in -s- (and others?) augmented with material drawn from past indicative forms of PIE (x)es-: s-esm̩ B(> səsa > shë), es (> heh), [-∅, or -id?], -s-omos  [-(ː)më] (note 1PL kjeshmë "was", -sete, -sonti . This explains Gheg outcomes in 1sg -ā, 2sg -ae ... etc. 
$ using augments in aorists, in xe-
$ it seems there was a stress retraction that was at least still going on when the earliest Greek loanwords entered, that effected many paradigms, that was done by the point of Latin contact. 
$ using n-j-é/ó for -nj- presents, likely from nasal infix with -e- reduced to -j-. 
$ using -akʷyos rather than -ikʷyos -- makes more sense for -u(a/o/e)s in enlarguemnt from o-stem verbs. Also Durrës. 
$ -i-eh2 as source of collective/feminine derivational suffix -í, def. -ía
$ plural -ëra/-na < -īna per Orel 2000(:229), which causes i-mutation, from a "collectivizing" PIE -īna he says. I'm treating this as from adjectivalizing -iHn(-os) + collectivizing -eχ. Since feminine of the latter is listed without accent, ot putting it on, for now. 
$ MPL i-mutating -ër/-ën treated as from -énes, plural of PIE suffix *-éːn forming nouns of roots, more in line with De Vaan 2004: 71; Schumacher 2013(:2019) has it via -inih; Orel 2000(: 230) instead has a proposed PIE *-ino for these.

ˌe n x ˈe s t i , ˈə ʃ t ə $verb, be.SG.PRES. Alternate theory to the above, per Hamp 1980: 341 apud Joseph 2016: 132-3. This theory has the advanteage of a parallel in Koine Greek enesti, with a corresponding short for eni, based on adverb/ preverb. Contact may be involved for these parallels in Koine Greek and Albanian (Hamp 1980 sees the Greek as a calque of the Albanian; Matzinger and Schumacher see the reverse -- Joseph 2016: 132. I note however that a Greek 'eni borrowed into Archaic Proto Albanian would become *i, not ë). Also proposed is inlaut nasal infix or analogy from esonti > janë (Orel 2000: 179). However I posit a nasal present infix and extension with -tod (see below), and that e
$x n s t ˈo d , ˈə ʃ t ə $verb, be.3SG.PRES. My proposal A, alternate to the above: a nasal infix present, weak root, with extension in -tod (to explain PAlb -a > -ë). -- nah, it results in a non-nasal vowel.

x s m ˈe s i , j ˈɛ m i $verb, BE.1PL.PRES. This is a proposal. Form per Kapovic 2017: 93, proposal is it's directly inherited (with initial x > e, then stress shift). TODO however Joseph 2016(:135-6) sees this as analogical.

A sonorant stem that became o-grade per Orel 2000: 218, a point Schumacher (2013: 209) also implies although while Orel has -a as the reflex of Proto-Albanian -os, Schumacher has -ʉh; Demiraj also seems to agree. Seems to show root accent etymologically, given gj- rather than sh- outcome. Consider shtërpinj below. Orel 200(:49, 61, 218) has -ena < -enos, Schumacher (2013: 209) has a PAlb SG -anʉh and pl -ánai (; > Buzuku gjarpënë and PL gjarpanjë) which is presumably < -onos, -onoi, while Demiraj is unsure: "-e/ono". Buzuku's variety seems to reflect -o- > -a- but Tosk purals appear to be gjarpinj, gjarpij, (and gjarpra, likely from n-stem acc pl amphikinetic -V́nn̩s)... which appear if anything to suggest -e- for plural. Unclear.
