Novel proposals: 

torkull/trokull (variant forms, f.) "wooden olive press" (Newmark 1998: 871, 879), with torkull as the etymological form and trokull as 
metathesized, from Latin torculum "olive press, wine press" (REW 8792a, p666). This is thus a doublet of tork "trough used for crushing 
grapes", an analogical singular of a loan from Italian torchio (Orel 1998: 460). 

Peshkëtar "kingfisher" as direct reflex of Latin piscato:rem "fisher", cf. also peshkatar "fisherman, angler" (on defs -- Newmark 1998(: 638)).

Found online but not in scholarly sources (yet?) : 

l ˈɑ w d ɑ m , l ˈa v d ə $eulogy. TODO cite or propose. Not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998 it seems.

l ˌɑ w d ˈɑː t ɑ m , l ə v d ˈa t ə $eulogy. TODO cite or propose. Not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998 it seems.

w ˌɑ l ˈoː r e m , v l ˈɛ ɾ ə $value. TODO cite or propose. Found online but not in scholarly sources? Seems to be absent from Orel 1998 and Bonnet 1998.

t ˈe m p l u m , t ˈɛ m p u lˠ $chapel, temple. TODO cite or propose -- can be found online, but at least does not seem to be in Bonnet 1998's index, nor in Orel 1998...?  

t r ˌɑː d i t ˈoː r e m , t ɾ a ð ə t ˈa ɾ $traitor. Variant: tradhtar. TODO cite, reexamine. Not in Orel 1998, also not in Bonnet 1998.  Can be found online but is it in any scholarly sources? If not TODO add to proposals. 

t r ˌi f ˈo l i u m , t ə ɾ f ˈi l $clover. For definition, but not etymology -- Newmark 1998: 865. Bonnet 1998(: 78, 126) discusses 

tërfojë (< TRIFOLIVM) but not this. Also not in Orel 1998. This definition is online but is it in any scholarly sources? TODO if not, propose. 

s p ˌe r ˈɑ n t i ɑ , ʃ p r ˈɛ s ə $hope. TODO cite or propose -- this etymology can be found online (e.g. here, as from sperans -- 
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sperans#Latin -- see paradigm, would have to be singularized from pl sperantia but cf. inherited Sp. 
esperanza, Ital. speranza, Old Occ esperanssa > Occ. esperança, etc...), but is this in scholarly works? Lack of nasal in Gheg may be 
issue unless it's a loan from Tosk. Orel 1998(:431) instead considers it derived from shp(ë)rej; Bonnet 1998(:304) seems to accept this 
with reservations. Other etymologies (unsourced?) online think it is a native formation. 

ɡ ˌɑ r r i ˈɑː r e , ɟ ɾ ˈɔ j $verb: to chat, with same in Latin barrier (with wide reflexes).  = Gjëroj? Considered "unknown" by some. TODO cite, found only online thus far. Not in Orel 1998. Bonnet 1998(: 349) discusses it only as coming instead from IV:RA:RE, and discusses Lat. GARRI:RE only in terms of Alb. garris "to bray" (Bonnet 1998: 300-301). 

f r ˌiː ɡ u l ˈɑː r e , f ə ɾ ɡ ə lˠ ˈɔ j $verb: to shiver, tremble, quiver; snort (Newmark 1998: 218). TODO cite a scholarly source or propose -- not in Orel 1998 nor Bonnet 1998. 

f ˌo r t ˈuː n ɑ m , f u ɾ t ˈu n ə $storm. May not be direct. Cf. Romanian furtună. See also in Greek and Turkish? TODO cite something scholarly -- not in Bonnet 1998 nor Orel 1998. 

ˌe k s k ˌu r t ˈɑː r e , ʃ k u ɾ t ˈɔ j $verb: cut ,abbreviate, trim, shorten. May be formed later from shkurt? TODO cite something scholarly -- not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998. 

pʰ ˈɑ r u m , f ˈa r $lighthouse (Newmark 1998: 213). TODO cite something scholarly; not in Bonnet 1998, nor Orel 1998 it seems.

r ˌɑː d ˈiː k eː s , ɾ a ð ˈi c e $bitter root, chicory, succory (Newmark 1998: 725).  From the plural of Latin radix. This (or accusative sg rādīcem?) is also the source in some Romance languagesː Italian radice, Mozarabic radici, (OHG rātih), Dalmatian radaica, Ligurian reixa, Sicilian radica, Venetian raixa. TODO cite; not in Orel 1998 or Bonnet 1998. 

r ˌe ɡ i ˈoː n e m , ɾ a j ˈɔ n $region. This looks suspicious. Why /j/ not /ɟ/? Why /̟e/ > /a/? May be from a Romance language: Old French royon. Venetian rejon? Angevin rayon cf. Marr 2023? TODO: cite something scholarly reexamine; not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998. Could it even be something like a Russian loan? 

p ˈe n d e u l u s , p ˈɛ z u lˠ $suspended, abolished. Normal Latin would be pendulus that appears phonologically to be tied to pendo, pendere, but it's plausible we are dealing with an analogized form based on pendeo, pendēre (which was originally, opaquely, the actual source of pendulusǃ). TODO cite scholarly source, reexamine, remove or propose; is there is nasalism in Gheg? Not in Bonnet 1998 nor Orel 1998... 


TO Italian or not? 

ˌo f f ˈe r r e , ɔ f ɾ ˈɔ j $verb: to offer. This is from online, not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998. Dashi 2017 attributes it to Italian. 

ˌo f f ˈe r t ɑ , ɔ f ˈɛ ɾ t ə $offer (noun). Not in Orel 1998 or Bonnet 1998, proposed as loaned from Italian offerta by Dashi 2017(:304) but seeing that this Late Latin offerta has many other cognate reflexes in Romance, I propose it as from Latin here. 


To Old French? 

w ˈeː l u m , v ˈɛ l $veil, transparent cloth of fine fibers (Newmark 1998: 913). Not in Orel 1998, nor Bonnet 1998.  Attributed to Latin vēlum, but this may make more sense (with the single l in mind) 
as a loan from Old French veil and Occitan vel. TODO may need to reexamine -- or attribute to Angevin, cf. Marr 2023. 

p ˌɑ r t ˈiː t ɑ , p a r t ˈi $(political, legal) party. Attributed to Latin online (TODO cite scholarly source -- not in Bonnet 1998, nor Orel 1998), yet Old French parti and or partie (in the sense of "part" and "party (law)") seems very likely responsible, given the loss of t in VtV and the semantics... sometimes attributed to medieval Latin, but this doesn't explain the loss of -t- (cf. Marr 2023). TODO cite, reexamine.
