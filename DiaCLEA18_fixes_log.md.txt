Not counting "uninteresting" formatting related changes that were also done to fix the baselines. 

# A. Rule insertion

Rules that were inserted because of missed phenomena or to make other phenomena work. These are effectively proposals. 

## A1 Insertion of phenomena that are quite reminiscent of other phenomena in the baseline cascade. 

A1.I - later Middle Proto-Albanian deletion of schwa in R m __ N 

A1.II -- final -n deleted in the latter part of Middle Proto-Albanian.

A1.III -- final -ɲ deleted in modern standard Albanian except after u. 

A1.IV -- nw (or nβ) > m before e in Middle Proto-Albanian, after the passage of Latin /ɪ/ and /eː/ (but not /e/) to /e/. Unspecified for stress (i.e. as [+front,-hi,+tense]), though in fact all effected cases concern countertonic /ˌe/ it seems. This seems to cover all cases of Latin -nv- > Alb. m except for potentially mërrajë, if its etymology in Latin invernālia (> Middle Proto-Albanian *enβˌɛrnˈɑʎɑ) is correct. 

A1.V -- temporary gemination of n between stressed high vowel and final ə, in late Proto-Albanian or early Proto-Tosk, blocking rhotacism in these environments (e.g. shpinë, shëllinë, trinë, etc. One exception is rrëshirë it seems. Not internallyː monachus > murg). 

## A2 Insertion of phenomena that are something new under the sun from the perspective of the baseline. 

A2.I - l > ʎ / [+hi] __ [+hi],  inserted after the emergence of dark L 
	(which it counterbleeds, and which in DiaCLEA18 occurs much earlier because the posited intermediate long *l: stage is replaced by an immediate of its would-be reflex, dark l, /lˠ/). 

A2.II - j > ∅ disappearance of j after w in APA. Handles at least three etymaː laqueum > lak, quiētum > qet-ë, salviella > shërbelë (especially the latter; we do not see shërbgjelë or shërgjelë). Perhaps also alveolum > *lullë > nullë "gum", if we believe in that etymology. Inserted at rule 19, which currently is just before the deletion of /w/ in APA ... though this may change. 

A2.III -- ina > inia rule inserted into Antique Proto-Albanian

A2.IV -- -ˈV ol(-u(m/s),-a(m))  endings see stress shift onto the /o/; this is placed into Latin input handling as it is known to occur widely elsewhere in Romance.

A2.V -- yod deleted after palatals and postalveolars in Late Proto-Albanian.

A2.VI -- final nasal sequences resolve in favor of the first element: scamnum > ... >> shkëmb, stamnum > ... > (Gheg?) shtam, damnum > ... > dëm, pignus > ... > peng, terminum > *tjɛrəmənə > tjermn (cf. A1.I) > ... > qerm, signus (insignē?) > ... > sheng. There seems to be an alternate outcome for mn in -më, and for ŋn in -ɲə (një), but the conditions are unclear except that it only happens after vowels, and this is not implemented for now (exāmen > shemë, flāmen (or flāminem?) > flamë, dignus > denjë...) 

A2.VII -- two rounds of pretonic nasal cluster simplification. Pretonically, nasal sequences resolve to the second element, and at least in the case of /n/, a long variant is what emerges -- sign-āre > shënoj, cognatus > kunat, damn-āre > dënoj, communic-āre > kungoj, carminare > karmini-ā- > kernjoj

A2.VIII -- o and o: > u before non-palatal sonorants in pre-penultimate syllables, with some finer grained distinctions. Occurs after gliding and the formation of ɲ and ʎ; counterbled by the Latin nasal-fricative phenomenon, requiring that be relocdated to after it (B1.I).

A2.IX -- Latin pʰ > f inserted into Latin input handling, contrasting with handling of kʰ and tʰ

A2.X -- Middle Proto-Albanian /ɪ/ becomes /i/ instead of /e/ when immediately before ʎ or labials (five cases at present for ˈɪʎ; and 4 for ˈɪp and ˈɪf together; ˈɪ followed by other labials unattested)

A2.XI -- long/tense non-high vowels are rounded under in the influence of round vowels on the other side of ɲ. In the case of ē, this development is blocked by preceding coronals, but proceeds otherwise. (Possibly something similar for r j?) 

A2.XII -- h deleted before non-stressed syllables and after any vowels. 

A2.XIII -- y and ø retract to u and o before n and ɲ (though not m and ŋ) in Middle Proto-Albanian, before the diphthongization of ø and o. 

# B Rule relocdation

Rules that were moved to different points in the cascade. 

## B1 -- rule moved to a later time

B1.I -- Latin nasal-fricative phenomenon moved to after the pre-penultimate o/o: to u raising (A2.VIII)

## B2 -- rule moved to an earlier time 

B2.I - DV1740E3, ln and ll > l, moved to before lambdacism (moved from rule instant 13 to 10), as it seems to feed it. 

B2.II - DV1740F3 -- the lengthening of intervocalic l (and sl > l: (...> lˠ)) before non-front vowels (which is now just straight to darkening, per D3.I) is moved to before DV1740E3 after it was moved forward, as DV1740E3 counterfeeds it. In order to do so, [-front] is now explicitly stipulated in the posterior context. 

## B3 -- possible relocdations to pre-Latin period out of deletions to test (TODO!) 

B3.I -- D1.I - DV1740G2: intervocalic lambdacism before front vowels 

B3.II -- D1.II -- DV1740F2: l coalescence with nearby resonant to dark L, see also B4.I

## B4 -- possible relocdations to later periods out of deletions to test (TODO!) 

B4.I -- D1.II -- DV1740F2: l coalescence with nearby resonant to dark L, see also B3.II 


# C Changes in conditioning to improve accuracy

Rule input, output, or context conditioning changed. These are done to improve accuracy 

## C1 -- changes in input 

### C1A -- input made broader

C1A.I -- prosthesis of w- before initial ō now broadened to also occur before initial short ǒ

C1A.II -- DV3.1B2 degemination/shortening of nː (nn) to n is broadened to other long nasal consonants as may be necessary.

### C1B -- input made narrower

C1B.I - Gliding rule (R9 in baseline): [-prim] --> [-stres], countertonic vowels are excempted from gliding at this time. 

C1B.II -- DV1740F3 -- now only applies to r l 

C1B.III -- DV2.2.2c -- first reduction (and then loss) of internal posttonic vowels now does not occur for low vowels... yet. 

C1B.IV -- DV1736.G1 / DV2.2.1L1 -- ō does actually go to ø, not *uo, before word-final r if it comes after a continuant (mësherë, herë, vlerë, tmerr...)

C1B.V -- DV2.2.1B4 -- ʎ does not trigger i-mutation. It is clear it does not for ˈa (but still does for ˈe, at least ˈe from Latin short ǐ) -- cf. alium > aj, fallium > faj, malleus > maj, pallia >pajë, tālea > tajë, rōsālia > rrëshajë. It also does not trigger i-mutation for ˈu it seems, at least based on vitulea > Middle Proto-Albanian *βetˈuʎɑ > ftujë. There don't seem to be any examples of /ˈɛʎ/ or /ˈoʎ/ at this time. There are various cases where it does appear on the surface to do so for /e/ but all of these are for former [ɪ], like scintīlia > shkëndijë etc, and htese may show a different patterning than i-mutation (familia > fëmijë, suavilla > shijë), so this is better handled by a separate rule it seems. 

## C2 -- changes in output 

## C3 -- changes in context conditioning 

### C3A -- context made broader

### C3B -- context made narrower

C3B.I -- "preconsonantal" ʃ to t͡ʃ in most recent modern Albanian is now only pre-nasal
	(this fix increased accuracy by a whole 1% alone)

C3B.II -- ai > ē blocked prevocalically. 

C3B.III -- major changeǃ 
i-mutation blocked by prior labial elements
		-- this change alone, not made finer, led to a 1.3% increase in accuracy, at an early stage
		and many of the words it did not fix, it set on the right track. 
			-- though further changes are needed to both the specification and the timing of i-mutation it seems... 
Based on one example, it also doesn't occur word initially, so instead of {[-lab];#} for prior context, we get to use the simpler [-lab].

C3B.IV -- DV1744J3, k,g > j / __ [-round,-stres] t,  now has the vowel become [+front] rather than [-round] (changing outcomes when it is [ə] or [a]).

C3B.V -- raising before s/ʃ turned out to only be accurate when there was also a /j/ in the next syllable. This also meant it could effectively be merged into i-mutation, triggering D2.I.

C3B.VI -- 4.1B3 m > mb before unstressed vowel now limited to occur non-initially and with an /l/ on the other side of the unstressed vowel (grumbulloj, shëmbëlltyrë, (m)bletë) 

## C4 -- changes in both input and output

## C5 -- changes in both input and context conditioning

## C6 -- changes in both output and context conditioning

## C7 -- all three changed. 


# D Rule deletion and cascade simplification

Rules that were deleted, or rather suppressed technically (they were commented out) because there was not much to be gained by keeping them, and/or there was much to be lost. This will also include rule consolidation. 

##D1 -- rules deleted to improve accuracy

D1.I - DV1740G2: intervocalic lambdacism before front vowels
	  it behaved correctly in two cases, and erros in 28
	- of the one it behaved correctly in, it was unnecessary to get the result. 
	- and the remaining correct case, vjej "I need", could have been actually from some sort of *valiere or *valiare rather than the attested valēre for all we know. 

D1.II - h-insertion rule deleted.

D1.III -- DV3.1A2, that is the passage of "PAlb β" to m before VN$ is deleted as it was errant more often than not. Some of its ground is instead covered by an inserted rule, A1.IV, at an earlier stage in Middle Proto-Albanian. 

##D2 -- rules deleted as they were redundant

D2.I -- it turned out that raising of /e/ before /s~ʃ/ (DV2.2.1A4.II) was only accurate when there was a /j/ in the following syllable, which means what was left of the rule once the context was narrowed to express could be merged into i-mutation.

##D3 -- consolidation of multiple rules into single rule. 

D3.I - DV1740F3: original rule was Lat *l > l: / V __ V[-front], now just having this go straight to lˠ as the step of having /lː/ turns out unnecessary, and the conditioning suggests a dark L. This thus involves the effecive deletion of DV3.1E. 

D3.II -- Kortlandt's early final s-deletion is consolidated with the deletion of final nasals, s and -ns that was originally placed right before the earliest vowel drops that were right before the flag for Middle Proto-Albanian. These are currently placed early in the period, where Kortlandt's shift had been placed. 



# E larger changes in progress, with things to consider... 


.... need to (re-?)work out the ordering and specific conditioning of many of the things below. 

-- moving the intervocalic stop drops to somewhere, maybe early Middle Proto-Albanian
	and/or considering cluster simplification alternatives to simple intervocalic stop drops
		this is caught up in the question of when unstressed vowels were lost -- when did those clusters form.

also related to the above ^ -- when did vowel reduction occur relative to i-mutation, and relative to intervocalic stop drops, which has major implications for the timing of i-mutation relative ot intervocalic stop drops
	... and the role of prior labials in potentially blocking i-mutation..

...come back to thisǃ 

working on file showing similarities between APA /b/ and /w/ developments... will come up with decisions and implement soon... 
	(for now fixing more basic things first ) 


there is also some sort of (pretonic?) beta and delta triggered cluster voicing phenomenon that appears to be missed this far, part of other general cluster simplifications that seem to be missed thus far... 

Voicing of pretonic secondary clusters involving a voiced stop(?) (> fricative(?)), and wiht -w- (> fricative β or v or βʷ)?
	exvigil-āre	> əkswəɡəl-aː	> z-gl-oj > zgjoj
	saburrum 	> səbˈurrə 	> zhur
	excaudic-āre 	> əksawdək-ˈaː	> shkag-oj
	medicastrum 	> mɛdəkˈastrə	> mëgashtër

Other cluster simplifications

vowel coloring by w and b at some point in proto-Albanian, probalby multiplke points -- wi >y phenomena, ibV > uo phenomena. V1wV2 > V1(ː,w) phenomena

w to v before stressed e. 

untangling the k(V)t phenomena...


possible blocking of i-mutation before ɲ and -rj- (> rʲ)? and loss of palatal after rj (or on rʲ) around this point 

revise handling of vowels in hiatus before (or during) vowel reductions and falls. 


a late(?) sr > r phenomenon that is fed by vowel falls -- miserem > mjerë? 
	note that DV3.2I2, the rC, Cr > r rules all use PIE -sr- and -rs- clusters to r... 
		the sr > r might have been this late ? 
			(see also dorë "hand" etc) 

some sort of nasal infix onto consonantal onset of penultimate syllable, originally a prefix? 
	(im-?)pedica > pengë 
	imperatōrem > perënduar
	(in-?)dracōnem > drangue (albeit Tosk dragua) 

nasal cluster simplifications.
