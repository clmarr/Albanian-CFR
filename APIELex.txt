$ it seems tehre was a stress retraction that was at least still going on when the earliest Greek loanwords entered, that effected many paradigms, that was done by the point of Latin contact. 
$ using n-j-é/ó for -nj- presents, likely from nasal infix with -e- reduced to -j-. 
$ using -akʷyos rather than -ikʷyos -- makes more sense for -u(a/o/e)s in enlarguemnt from o-stem verbs. Also Durrës. 
$ -i-eh2 as source of collective/feminine derivational suffix -í, def. -ía
$ plural -ëra/-na < -īna per Orel 2000(:229), which causes i-mutation, from a "collectivizing" PIE -īna he says. I'm treating this as from adjectivalizing -iHn(-os) + collectivizing -eχ. Since feminine of the latter is listed without accent, ot putting it on, for now. 
* MPL i-mutating -ër/-ën treated as from -énes, plural of PIE suffix *-éːn forming nouns of roots, more in line with De Vaan 2004: 71; Schumacher 2013(:2019) has it via -inih; Orel 2000(: 230) instead has a proposed PIE *-ino for these. 
$ per Orel 2000 and it seems others agree, resonant final noun-stems become -o- stems.

This theory has the advanteage of a parallel in Koine Greek enesti, with a corresponding short for eni, based on adverb/ preverb. Contact may be involved for these parallels in Koine Greek and Albanian (Hamp 1980 sees the Greek as a calque of the Albanian; Matzinger and Schumacher see the reverse -- Joseph 2016: 132. I note however that a Greek 'eni borrowed into Antique Proto Albanian would become *i, not ë). Also proposed is inlaut nasal infix or analogy from esonti > janë (Orel 2000: 179). However I posit a nasal present infix and extension with -tod (see below), and that e
