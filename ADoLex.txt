$Pre-Proto-Albanian,modern Tosk
$ Doric loans to Albanian. 
$TODO currently through p246 on Huld 1986, continue. 

s p ˈeː l a i o n , ʃ p ˈɛ l ə $hole, grotto. Huld 1986(:250) as Attic (unlike other cases like mokër). Topalli 2017(ː1409) supports this as do some others (see Orel 1998(ː428)); Orel 1998(ː428) sees this instead as via Latin spelaeum however. 


b ˈa p t i s m a , b ˈa ɡ ə m $oil for anointment. Claimed as AGk by Orel 2000(:23) but semantics suggests it may belong instead to the Christian layer. Seriously consider removal. 

m ɑː kʰ ɑ n ˈɑː , m ˈɔ k ə ɾ $millstone. Gheg mokën. Huld 1986: 245-6. With stress shift to Albanian accentuation showing archaicness. Explicitly a Doric and not Attic item. 
m ˈɑː l ɑ , m ˈɔ lˠ ə $apple. From plural of neuter Doric mālon, the source of Latin malum. De Vaan 2018: 1738; Schumacher & Matzinger 2013: 221 (within which, explicitly Doric). Attributed as a very early Latin loan from mālum by Orel 2000: 31.

$ below here are those I view as suspicious, and/or likely later Greek loans. 

w ˈo j n ɑː , v ˈɛ ɾ ə $wine. Huld 1986: 246. But this could just be inherited from PPAlb wainā -- as most sources have it.
