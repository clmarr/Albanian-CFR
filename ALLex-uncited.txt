b ˌe n e d ˈi k t u m , b d ˈɛ k $a given name, cf. to Benoit, Bennet etc. TODO cite or propose, not in Bonnet 1998. 
b ˈuː f u m , b ˈu f $owl.  TODO cite a scholarly source, or propose -- not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998 it seems. Cf Romanian buf, Spanish buho, AGk bouphos. 
k ˈiː w i t ˈɑː t ˈoː r e m , c y t ɛ t a ɾ $citizen. Actually derived from qytet? TODO cite a scholarly source or propose; does not seem to be in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998...

d ˌɑ n i ˈeː l e m , d a ɲ ˈɛ lˠ $Daniel. Likely actually a slightly later loan? TODO cite a scholarly source or propose; does not seem to be in Bonnet. 
ˌe k s k ˌu r t ˈɑː r e , ʃ k u ɾ t ˈɔ j $verb: cut ,abbreviate, trim, shorten. May be formed later from shkurt? TODO cite something scholarly -- not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998.
f ˌo r t ˈuː n ɑ m , f u ɾ t ˈu n ə $storm. May not be direct. Cf. Romanian furtună. See also in Greek and Turkish? TODO cite something scholarly -- not in Bonnet 1998 nor Orel 1998.  
f r ˌiː ɡ u l ˈɑː r e , f ə ɾ ɡ ə lˠ ˈɔ j $verb: to shiver, tremble, quiver; snort (Newmark 1998: 218). TODO cite a scholarly source or propose -- not in Orel 1998 nor Bonnet 1998.

l ˌɑ w d ˈɑː t ɑ m , l ə v d ˈa t ə $eulogy. TODO cite or propose. Not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998 it seems. Reexamine, may be Alb formation (-atë ? ) 
l ˈiː b e r u m , l ˈi b ə ɾ $book.  TODO cite. Not in Bonnet 1998 nor Orel 1998 it seems. Important to examine this one as it is a likely later loan or later Latin learnedism (as is the case with French libre). Dashi 2017(: 255) considers the secondary meaning of libër as a specific measurement unit to be a loan from Italian, but does not list the main meaning in book. 
m ˌɑ ɡ i s t e r ˈɑː r e , m a ʃ t ɾ ˈɔ j $verb: to dupe, deceive. TODO cite something scholarly, reexamine, remove or propose; not in Orel 1998 or 2000 or Bonnet 1998. 
m ˌɑ r ˈiː k ɑ m , m ɾ i k ə $Mary. Variant: Mëri from maria. TODO cite. 
p ˌɑ r t ˈiː t ɑ , p a r t ˈi $(political, legal) party. Attributed to Latin online (TODO cite scholarly source -- not in Bonnet 1998, nor Orel 1998), yet Old French parti and or partie (in the sense of "part" and "party (law)") seems very likely responsible, given the loss of t in VtV and the semantics... sometimes attributed to medieval Latin, but this doesn't explain the loss of -t- (cf. Marr 2023). TODO cite, reexamine. 
p ˈe n d e u l u s , p ˈɛ z u lˠ $suspended, abolished. Normal Latin would be pendulus that appears phonologically to be tied to pendo, pendere, but it's plausible we are dealing with an analogized form based on pendeo, pendēre (which was originally, opaquely, the actual source of pendulusǃ). TODO cite scholarly source, reexamine, remove or propose; is there is nasalism in Gheg? Not in Bonnet 1998 nor Orel 1998... 
p r ˌiː s t ˈiː n ɑ , p ɾ i ʃ t ˈi n ə $Prishtina. May be problematic, re-examine. TODO cite, reexamine; remove or propose. 
r ˌɑː d ˈiː k eː s , ɾ a ð ˈi c e $bitter root, chicory, succory (Newmark 1998: 725).  From the plural of Latin radix. This (or accusative sg rādīcem?) is also the source in some Romance languagesː Italian radice, Mozarabic radici, (OHG rātih), Dalmatian radaica, Ligurian reixa, Sicilian radica, Venetian raixa. TODO cite something scholarly; not in Orel 1998 or Bonnet 1998. 
r ˌe ɡ i ˈoː n e m , ɾ a j ˈɔ n $region. This looks suspicious. Why /j/ not /ɟ/? Why /̟e/ > /a/? May be from a Romance language: Old French royon. Venetian rejon? Angevin rayon cf. Marr 2023? TODO: cite something scholarly reexamine; not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998. Could it even be something like a Russian loan? 
s p ˌe r ˈɑ n t i ɑ , ʃ p r ˈɛ s ə $hope. TODO cite or propose -- this etymology can be found online (e.g. here, as from sperans --https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sperans#Latin -- see paradigm, would have to be singularized from pl sperantia but cf. inherited Sp. esperanza, Ital. speranza, Old Occ esperanssa > Occ. esperança, etc...), but is this in scholarly works? Lack of nasal in Gheg may be issue unless it's a loan from Tosk. Orel 1998(:431) instead considers it derived from shp(ë)rej; Bonnet 1998(:304) seems to accept this with reservations. Other etymologies (unsourced?) online think it is a native formation. 
t ˈe m p l u m , t ˈɛ m p u lˠ $chapel, temple. TODO cite or propose -- can be found online, but at least does not seem to be in Bonnet 1998's index, nor in Orel 1998...?  
t r ˌɑː d i t ˈoː r e m , t ɾ a ð ə t ˈa ɾ $traitor. Variant: tradhtar. TODO cite, reexamine, remove or propose. Not in Orel 1998, also not in Bonnet 1998. Can be found online but is it in any scholarly sources? 
t r ˌi f ˈo l i u m , t ə ɾ f ˈi l $clover. For definition, but not etymology -- Newmark 1998: 865. Bonnet 1998(: 78, 126) discusses tërfojë (< TRIFOLIVM) but not this. Also not in Orel 1998. This definition is online but is it in any scholarly sources? TODO if not, propose. 
w ˌɑ l ˈoː r e m , v l ˈɛ ɾ ə $value. TODO cite or propose. Seems to be absent from Orel 1998 and Bonnet 1998.
