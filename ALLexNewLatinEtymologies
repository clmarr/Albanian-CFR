Novel proposals: 

torkull/trokull (variant forms, f.) "wooden olive press" (Newmark 1998: 871, 879), with torkull as the etymological form and trokull as 
metathesized, from Latin torculum "olive press, wine press" (REW 8792a, p666). This is thus a doublet of tork "trough used for crushing 
grapes", an analogical singular of a loan from Italian torchio (Orel 1998: 460). 

Peshkëtar "kingfisher" as direct reflex of Latin piscato:rem "fisher", cf. also peshkatar "fisherman, angler" (on defs -- Newmark 1998(: 638)).

Placenames

d ˈu r r ɑ tʃ u m , d ˈu r ə s $Durrës. This is a NOVEL proposal though foreshadowed by Bonnet 1998(:37)'sa remarks about the outcome -s- from what looks like a Latin and Greek /kʰiu-/, rather than the expected /c/ <q>. Italian likewise has Durazzo rather than expected Duraccio; Slavic Drač. The idea here is that the Latin Durrachium and perhaps the Greek Dyrrhakhium actually overlie a Proto-Albanian /tʃ/ (using this sound as it is what is used in Proto-Albanian as the reflex of PIE *kʷ before i/e by De Vaan 2018 and Orel 2000), rather than a /kiu/ or /kju/, which is plausible as this sound was lacking in both languages. Regarding the accent, once we no longer have the penultimate -I-, then the /u/ becomes antepenultimate, and the stress on it falls out easily from this proposal! 


Reconsider

k w ˈiː s , c ˈy ʃ $how. Rare alternative to "si". From locativization of Latin quī, if that is the root of që. Orel 1998: 364. The direct phonological descent from quis here may not be what he intended though, check? <- TODO.


Found online, removed for dubiousness for now -- consult : 


k ˈɑ t u l ɑ m , k ɔ t ˈɛ l ɛ $kitten. This etymology is dubious, may need checking. TODO cite. Not in Orel 1998, nor Bonnet 1998 it seems? Check with Lindon etc. 


Found online but not in scholarly sources (yet?) : 

m ˌɑ ɡ i s t e r ˈɑː r e , m a ʃ t ɾ ˈɔ j $verb: to dupe, deceive. TODO cite something scholarly, reexamine, remove or propose; not in Orel 1998 or 2000 or Bonnet 1998. 


l ˈi t t e r ɑ m , l ˈɛ t ə ɾ $letter, playing card, paper, foil. May be via Italian lettera -- cf. Dashi 2017(: 255); may need to reconsider. Not in Bonnet 1998 nor Orel 1998 nor Orel 2000... 


l ˈiː b e r u m , l ˈi b ə ɾ $book.  TODO cite. Not in Bonnet 1998 nor Orel 1998 it seems. Important to examine this one as it is a likely later loan or later Latin learnedism (as is the case with French libre). Dashi 2017(: 255) considers the secondary meaning of libër as a specific measurement unit to be a loan from Italian, but does not list the main meaning in book. 

k ˈiː w i t ˈɑː t ˈoː r e m , c y t ɛ t a ɾ $citizen. Actually derived from qytet? TODO cite a scholarly source or propose; does not seem to be in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998...

t r ˌi f ˈo l i u m , t ə ɾ f ˈi l $clover. For definition, but not etymology -- Newmark 1998: 865. Bonnet 1998(: 78, 126) discusses 

tërfojë (< TRIFOLIVM) but not this. Also not in Orel 1998. This definition is online but is it in any scholarly sources? TODO if not, propose. 

s p ˌe r ˈɑ n t i ɑ , ʃ p r ˈɛ s ə $hope. TODO cite or propose -- this etymology can be found online (e.g. here, as from sperans -- 
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sperans#Latin -- see paradigm, would have to be singularized from pl sperantia but cf. inherited Sp. 
esperanza, Ital. speranza, Old Occ esperanssa > Occ. esperança, etc...), but is this in scholarly works? Lack of nasal in Gheg may be 
issue unless it's a loan from Tosk. Orel 1998(:431) instead considers it derived from shp(ë)rej; Bonnet 1998(:304) seems to accept this 
with reservations. Other etymologies (unsourced?) online think it is a native formation. 

ɡ ˌɑ r r i ˈɑː r e , ɟ ɾ ˈɔ j $verb: to chat, with same in Latin barrier (with wide reflexes).  = Gjëroj? Considered "unknown" by some. TODO cite, found only online thus far. Not in Orel 1998. Bonnet 1998(: 349) discusses it only as coming instead from IV:RA:RE, and discusses Lat. GARRI:RE only in terms of Alb. garris "to bray" (Bonnet 1998: 300-301). 

f r ˌiː ɡ u l ˈɑː r e , f ə ɾ ɡ ə lˠ ˈɔ j $verb: to shiver, tremble, quiver; snort (Newmark 1998: 218). TODO cite a scholarly source or propose -- not in Orel 1998 nor Bonnet 1998.

r ˌɑː d ˈiː k eː s , ɾ a ð ˈi c e $bitter root, chicory, succory (Newmark 1998: 725).  From the plural of Latin radix. This (or accusative sg rādīcem?) is also the source in some Romance languagesː Italian radice, Mozarabic radici, (OHG rātih), Dalmatian radaica, Ligurian reixa, Sicilian radica, Venetian raixa. TODO cite; not in Orel 1998 or Bonnet 1998. 

r ˌe ɡ i ˈoː n e m , ɾ a j ˈɔ n $region. This looks suspicious. Why /j/ not /ɟ/? Why /̟e/ > /a/? May be from a Romance language: Old French royon. Venetian rejon? Angevin rayon cf. Marr 2023? TODO: cite something scholarly reexamine; not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998. Could it even be something like a Russian loan? 

p ˈe n d e u l u s , p ˈɛ z u lˠ $suspended, abolished. Normal Latin would be pendulus that appears phonologically to be tied to pendo, pendere, but it's plausible we are dealing with an analogized form based on pendeo, pendēre (which was originally, opaquely, the actual source of pendulusǃ). TODO cite scholarly source, reexamine, remove or propose; is there is nasalism in Gheg? Not in Bonnet 1998 nor Orel 1998... 


k ˌɑ p t i ˈɑː t ɑ m , k a f ʃ ˈa t ə $bite (noun). May instead just be derived more recently from kafshoj but seems phonologically plausible that it came from the supine or the participle. TODOː get citation for this, not in Orel 1998 or Bonnet 1998.

TO Italian or not? 

ˌo f f ˈe r r e , ɔ f ɾ ˈɔ j $verb: to offer. This is from online, not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998. Dashi 2017 attributes it to Italian. 

ˌo f f ˈe r t ɑ , ɔ f ˈɛ ɾ t ə $offer (noun). Not in Orel 1998 or Bonnet 1998, proposed as loaned from Italian offerta by Dashi 2017(:304) but seeing that this Late Latin offerta has many other cognate reflexes in Romance, I propose it as from Latin here. 


To Old French? 

w ˈeː l u m , v ˈɛ l $veil, transparent cloth of fine fibers (Newmark 1998: 913). Not in Orel 1998, nor Bonnet 1998.  Attributed to Latin vēlum, but this may make more sense (with the single l in mind) 
as a loan from Old French veil and Occitan vel. TODO may need to reexamine -- or attribute to Angevin, cf. Marr 2023. 

p ˌɑ r t ˈiː t ɑ , p a r t ˈi $(political, legal) party. Attributed to Latin online (TODO cite scholarly source -- not in Bonnet 1998, nor Orel 1998), yet Old French parti and or partie (in the sense of "part" and "party (law)") seems very likely responsible, given the loss of t in VtV and the semantics... sometimes attributed to medieval Latin, but this doesn't explain the loss of -t- (cf. Marr 2023). TODO cite, reexamine. 

Debil -- attributed and learned Latin loan, but may be French? 

b ˌɑ t t u ˈɑː l i ɑ m , b ˌɛ t ˈɛ j ə $battle (Newmark 1998: 59). This etymology is not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998 though it can be found online, and the word is also discussed as participating in a certain phraseological calque of Italian, but not listed as an Italian loan, by Dashi 2017(:20). This is essentially here a weak proposal -- though possible loaning instead from Romance other than Italian here may warrant consideration (although there does not seem to be a likely source). 

m ˌɑ ɡ ˈiː ɑ , m a ɟ ˈi $magic, witchcraft (Newmark 1998: 484). This form may be from Old French magie? Treated by Bonnet 1998(:334) as "plus récent" 

p ˈe t t i ɑ m , p j ˈɛ s ə $part. May instead be Old French piece however, cf Marr 2023... Orel 1998: 331. Bonnet 384. 

p r ˈa e̯ d ɑ , p r ɛ $prey, quarry. Feminine -- def form preja (Mario got it for me). Direct from Latin praeda ("plunder, war spoils, prey, game in hunt, profit") may regularly go to predhë however... Cf Romanian and Aromanian pradă. Possibly an Angevin (or Norman?) loan -- vvariation between preie and proie in Old French, preie holds on most in Old Northern French and Anglo-Norman preie "booty, bounty, prey". Modern French proie. More likely from Old French than Occitan -- Occitan has preda (Portuguese: preia, Spanish: prea) -- may be more likely "Norman" than "Angevin"...  Note that the doublet predhë actually exists. Orel 1998: 342. Bonnet 384/169. De Vaan 2017: 1734. 

p ˈu l l ɑ m , p ˈu lˠ ə $chicken. May be < OF poule hence single l? But see also nulë < anulla, mulli < moli:num etc -- it's unnecessary. If from Old French, this would be an Angevin or Norman era loan. Occitan is not likely as it has /ʎ/ (which would render pujë) -- modern Occitan polhe, Catalan polla /poʎə/. Italian pollo also not a candidate, nor is Greek pouli. Orel 1998: 349. Bonnet 385. De Vaan 2017: 1735.

r ˌe ɡ i ˈoː n e m , ɾ a j ˈɔ n $region. This looks suspicious. Why /j/ not /ɟ/? Why /̟e/ > /a/? May be from a Romance language: Old French royon. Venetian rejon? Angevin rayon cf. Marr 2023? TODO: cite something scholarly reexamine; not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998. Could it even be something like a Russian loan? 


t r ˌɑ k t ˈɑː r e , t ɾ ˌa j t ˈɔ j $to treat, handle, process. Given semantics, we should consider the possibility that it is a loan from Old French traitier (< Latin TRACTAːRE, >> French traiter) . Orel 1998: 461. 

t r ˈɑ k t u s , t ɾ ˈa j t ə $form, shape, figure. Orel 1998: 461. Becomes feminine in Alb, ë from analogy on basis of noun class? However could be a loan from Old French trait [trajtʲ] (then with the  meaning "form, outline (of the face)", circa 13th cent.) < TRACTUS? (Cf. Marr 2023 on why this might have happened) (the OF term seems to be masculine though).

t ˈu r b ɑ , t ˈu ɾ b ə $turf. Cf French tourbe. Italian torba is from French though. From OF (cf. Marr 2023)? Orel 1998: 469. 

f ˈi d e m , f ˈɛ $religion. Attributed to fide:s by some but fidem by Orel 2000(:29). Orel 2000(:28-9) attributes it to "later layer of Latin loanwords" when short e reappeared. However, the loss of /d/ may be suspicious and suggest a later Romance loan. Candidates include: Old French fei ~ fai ~ foi, Old Occitan fe ~ fei, Venetian fè. Not candidatesː Sicilian fidi, Italian fede. Perhaps via Angevin (cf. Marr 2023). 

k ˈɑ n e m , c ˈɛ n $dog. Old Alb kjen? Gjakova Gheg: qan. Lack of Tosk rhotacism may be suspicious, opening the door that this may be a later loan. Candidates that marry phonological and historical plausibility include Old French chien cjɛn. Norman quien (cf Picard kien) is not an option here, nor is Occitan can. Seems a very likely Angevin loan. Note the vowel is not an issue for native though -- just the n rather than /ɾ/, which can in fact be explained as a Gheg to Tosk loan. Alternative from Latin after all ː < CANINVS. Orel 1998(:356) instead argues it's a "late loanword.. or rather from [Latin]'s Balkan continuations (Rum câine etc), reflecting no traces of rhotacism in Tosk... Camarda argues it is native from a PIE *cwōn, as does Hamp. De Vaan 2017: 1735 -- supports canem. 


k ˈo r t e m , k ˈu r t $yard. "Early" Latin per Orel 2000: 28. Or is this from Old French court < cohortem during the Angevins (cf. Marr 2023?)?

n ˈɑ p p ɑ , n ˈa p ə $cloth, napkin, towel, kerchief. Çabej, Haarmanë Meyer thinks it is via Old French nappe, Marr 2023 agrees. Orel 1998: 282. Bonnet 383.

p ˌɑ l ˈɑː t i u m , p ə lˠ a s $palace. But pëlles is expected. Orel 1998: 318. Bonnet 1998: p156, but doesn't explain vowel -a-. Per Orel 1998(:318). Marr 2023 attributes it to Angevin. 

p ˌɑ r ɑ d ˈiː s u s , p a r ˈi z $paradise. Orel 2000: 58. This etymology is disputed. Direct from Latin supported also by Orel 1998(:312), MIklosich, Tagliavini, Cabej, but Meyer suggests instead Italian paradiso; while Bonnet 1998(:17) instead supports Old Venetian paraíso while noting also Old French pareis. Marr 2023 supports an Angevin loan. Best bet may in fact be Old French pareis via the Angevin period (att. 1100--). Relevant oïl forsmː parais/parays (Anglo-Norman 1184--1300), paraïs/paraÿs (Anglo-Norman 1119--1251; Norman 1125 ; French 1150--1211), pareis ( French 1174-- 1200), pareïs (French 1100; Anglo-Norman 1100s; Norman 1227) , parëis (French 1150-1175; Picard 1200s). 

t r ˈu m b ɑ , t ɾ ˈu m b ə $trumpet, water-pump. Orel 1998: 467. Form may have been trumba that was loaned, cf Ital tromba, or Angevin (cf Marr 2023). 


t ˈu r r e m , t ˈu r ə $tower. May have final ë by analogy since it's feminine. Alternate form torrë. Was already feminine in Latin. Final vowel innovated elsewhereː Italian torre, Sicilian turri, Old Occitan torre. Alternatively, this may be an Angevin era loan from Occitan. See also Venetian tore. Orel 1998: 470. De Vaan 2017: 1740 -- as turris > turrë meaning "pile" (same word though? Reexamine?). 

ɡ l ˈɑ n d u l ɑ m , ɟ ˈə n d ə ɾ $gland. Gheg: gjandra. Cf Romanian ghindură, Aromanian gljindură. Sometimes listed as gjendër with /ɛ/. Orel 1998: 135 as gjëndër. Bonnet 1998: 49, 241, 380 also as gjëndër. De Vaan 2017: 1742 as gjëndër. Gheg form: gjândër for Bonnet 1998(ː46), gjandër for Orel 1998(ː135). Orel 1998(:135) notes Tosk variants glëndër and grëndël "reflect the anlaut gl- and thus exclude the Italian etymology". Bonnet (p246, 250) notes also glëndërë (Arvanitika), grëndëlë (some other Arvanitika and in Cham), gianerr (Northwest Gheg) and gandër (Dibran). May be Angevin -- cf. Marr 2023.
