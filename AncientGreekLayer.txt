l ˈa kʰ a n o n , l ˈa k ə ɾ $cabbage, lettuce. Orel 2000(:23), Huld 1986(:250).


$TODO decisions on the below.
b ˈa p t i s m a , b ˈa ɡ ə m $oil for anointment. Claimed as AGk by Orel 2000(:23) but semantics suggests it may belong instead to the Christian layer. Seriously consider removal. 
s p ˈeː l a i o n , ʃ p ˈɛ l ə $hole, grotto. Huld 1986(:250) as Attic (unlike other cases like mokër). Topalli 2017(ː1409) supports this as do some others (see Orel 1998(ː428)); Orel 1998(ː428) sees this instead as via Latin spelaeum however. 

$TODO incorporate rest of Huld 1986, Orel 1998, Vatasesescu 2007, Bonnet 1998, Orel 2000.
