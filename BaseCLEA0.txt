$ Some liberties were taken in order to make sure rules apply as Vladimir Orel seems to have intended; explanations will be given as deemed 
$ necessary. 

$ STAGES: 
$ De Vaan 2018's "Pre-Proto-Albanian" is roughly equivalent to Orel 
$ 2000's "Early Proto-Albanian", and effectively a ~"Pre-Contact Proto-Albanian"
$ for our purposes. De Vaan 2018's "Proto-Albanian", and Orel 
$ 2000's "Later Proto-Albanian", are roughly equivalent to a ~"Post-Contact 
$ Proto-Albanian". 
$ For De Vaan, development of the oldest layer of Greek words (cf. Huld 1986) are also incorporated into this stage framework. 
$ Orel 2000 does treat Latin and Greek loans separately, but doesn't handle the difference in terms of chronology (unlike
$ his treatment of Slavic loans". Thus this first layer will be the pre-Greek and pre-Latin layer for now. 
$ and will be Antique Proto-Albanian -- as the "Makedonian" or oldest Greek layer in Albanian seems to date to the 5th cent BCE (Huld 1986: 248).

$ This cascade will not explicitly encode De Vaan 2018's proposals (new, 
$ and retentions from older work, alike) for Proto-Albanian developments 
$ from Proto-Indo-European, yet at least (as of March 14, 2023).

$ this may or (more probably) may not have been contemporaneous with the merger of PIE aspirate voiced stops into

$Orel 1.4.7.13 on p115 -- ns > ʃ
	$ handled in other cascade as part of Latin input handling due to Latin nasal fricative law -- which was in the 2nd century in Latin -- cf Pope 1934 s359 (as a "very early" phenomenon in Latin), also p73 s156ii; also Allen 1978(:27-31, 55-6). 
	$ unlike what happened in Latin, Orel does not give attribute a lengthening effect on prior vowels to this. 
	$ he gives no conditioning environment.

$stage, circa 500 CE, after first waves of Latin and Greek loans, but before the earliest Slavic loans (and the next waves of the former). Putative Gothic and Iranian loans should probably be entered around here too. 
=Later Proto-Albanian

$ intervocalically and after r, Latin d becomes ð (Orel p105), and this also happens for early Slavic loans (1.4.7.16 on p120), and also to Proto-Albanian *d in these positions (Orel 1.4.2.7); in the latter (Orel p65), Orel attributes this spirantization a date in the 10th to 12th century, and relates it to Greek influence -- so it is a much later phenomenon for him. 
$ this corresponds to a quite different treatment in DV1744.A and .E 
$ Orel's words describing the context are repeatedly "intervocalically and before r", but all examples also have the -dr- sequence surrounded  by vowels as well, so this is the interpretation of what he meant (which is quite consistent with the patterning for West Roman lenition more broadly)
