$from De Vaan 1738-9, order may need to be revised. 
$for now, (somewhat arbitrarily) coding laryngeals as specific sounds 
	$ since we can't handle h1 h2 h3 etc. -- or otherwise we'd have to define these in symbolDefs
$choose features closest to their coloring vowel . 
$ h for h1 -- no coloring effect negative for all feats (except cont.)	(or use ʔ ?) 
$ ħ for h2 -- -front +back -round -hi +lo --like a  
$ χʷ for h3 -- -front +back +round -hi -lo -- like o 
	$ TODO reconsider this, considering that APIELex has x χ and xʷ respectively for laryngeals 1 2 and 3
$ h2 and h3 can be minimally captured as +back,+cont
$ the three together can be captured for now as -cor,-son,+cont (unless we make h1 ʔ -- this is an argument not to) -- until any *f is developed. 
$ (x for Hamp's h4 if we need it? ) (or use h and make h1 ʔ ?) 	(or could use ? or h4) 
$ using j for i̯ and w for u̯
$ for the palatovelars : c ɟ ɟʰ
$ *a as it emerges is [ɑ], as this is ħ is closest to.

$DV1738~2.3C1 part 1, *e > *a ( really ɑ ) after *h2. Nothing listed for *h3 here. 
$ so most faithful formulation would be : [-hi,-round] > [+lo] / ħ __
$ but inasmuch as laryngeal vowel coloring is a widely accepted broad phenomenon of laryngeal-coloring within PIE, it is formulated explicitly in the way it is thought to work across branches; likewise it is expanded to include coloring by posterior laryngeals as well 
$ ultimately this is part of the implementation of the following: 
$   in the progressive coloring aspect: DV2.3C2, 2.3E2, 2.3F1, 2.3J2, 2.3K2
$   in the regressive coloring aspect: DV2.3E2, 2.3F1, 2.3G2, 2.3H1, 2.3J2, 2.3K2
[-hi,-lo,-round] > [βlo,ɣround,ðback,ɛfront] / [-cor,-son,+cont,βlo,ɣround,ðback,ɛfront] __
[-hi,-lo,-round] > [βlo,ɣround,ðback,ɛfront] / __ [-cor,-son,+cont,βlo,ɣround,ðback,ɛfront]

$DV1738~2.3C3 -- "*a < RHV" -- not sure I interpreted this right, he gives pare "first" as example; given the etymology in pr̩-h2-e/o I think he rather is intending for the R to pass to aR (...?), rather than it all to be absorbed into an *a which would be the literal interpretation of "RHV > a" by the system. 
$ this needs to be before 2.3A2 in order to get this effect for parë "first", so that is implemented. (also likely necessary to come before  the H-loss aspect of 2.3B1, 2.3C1, 2.3C2, 2.3E2 and 2.3F1, but this aspect of each will probably instead be handled by 1746.K4) 
$ Formulated so as to preserve maximal stress
$ 8/9/23 -- De Vaan confirms his 
∅ > ɑ / __ [+cons,+syl] [-cor,-son,+cont] [+syl] 
ɑ [+cons,βstres,ɣprim] > [βstres,ɣprim] [-syl] 

$Per general understanding of laryngeal behavior, laryngeals efface and lengthen prior vowels (after coloring them) when before consonants or the word boundary. This is touched upon in various DV'18 rules as an aspect, with each rule effectively handling the effacement of hte laryngeal and the ensuing prior vowel lengthening separately in parallel: 2.3E, 2.3G1, 2.3G2, 2.3H1, 2.3I1 -- but inspection of all the examples given show that while this is not explicated, all these VH cases are VHC or VH#, which is in line with the broad understanding of how this phenomenon occured across most core IE branches. 
$rules that are essentially accomplished here: the *iH > *i: aspect of 2.3E, 2.3F2 (fed by laryngeal vowel coloring), 2.3G1's eh1 > ē aspecet, 2.3H1's oH and eh3 aspects (the latter fed by laryngeal vowel coloring)
[+syl] [-cor,-son,+cont] > [+long] ∅ / __ {[+cons];#}

$DV1738~2.3C4 -- *h2 and *h3 become *a before syllabic resonants. Reformulated here so that stress is preserved and the resonants lose resonance in a single rule. 
$this may actually be multiple phenomena, with a later *o created by this rule or other phenommena involving h3 later merging to *a, but it's handled as one phenomenon by De Vaan 2018 it seems. It is actually simpler to let h3 pass to *o here and then become *a via 2.3C1 here though, so that's what this cascade does. 
$maximally faithful form without doing this would be: [+back,+cont] [+syl,+cons,βstres,ɣprim] > [+lo,-hi,-round,+tense,+voi,-strid,βstres,ɣprim] [-syl]
$based on the case of arë "field" given as an example, it seems this is not intended to be bled by DV2.3A1, so it is placed before it. 
[+back,+cont,+cons] [+syl,+cons,βstres,ɣprim] > [βstres,ɣprim,+tense,+voi,-strid] [-syl]

$PREVOCALIC LARYNGEAL EFFACEMENT: per general understanding of laryngeal behavior in late PIE as it differentiated (but which is generally understood to be all IE except Anatolian?), prevocalic laryngeals are now effaced.
$This is implicit in (and thus implements aspects of) the rules DV2.3B1 (actually in this case it's the whole rule), DV2.3C1, DV2.3C2 (the other aspect being the abovehandled laryngeal vowel-coloring), 2.3E2, 2.3F1, 2.3J2 (the rest handled by laryngeal vowel-coloring), 2.3K2 (as above)

$DV1738~2.3C9 calls for insertion of PPAlb a (really ɑ) in between two consonants, but if interpreted to be deterministic this would cause massive errors. The given example is madh "big" < *m̥ĝ, but De Vaan 2018 hedges here, noting that Schumacher 2013(: 238) instead explains this item via analogy. Thus this is not implemented for now. 

$DV1738~2.3C1 : PIE *(H)o > *a	(really ɑ) 
$ unspecified for any differene in the stress of the *o, but clearly it's the short one.

$DV4.3I3 -- *Tt > *tʃ too. The single example pot-to is a dental stop; to resolve conflict between this rule and DV4.3Q3, I refer to the examples given by De Vaan 2018 in the latter, and these include -pt-, -ct-, and -kʷt- but on dentals. Given the past literature on the "thorn cluster", it makes sense to assume that this one targets a dental cluster, and effacement rule in DV4.3Q3 which would naturally compete with this, is place-independent and comes later -- in effect targeting non-dental stop

$merged in: 2.3I2 ~ PIE *-us- > ū / __ {l,r} 
$going to boldly assume this happened to all vowels since there are no counterexamples for -is- and -os- 
$TODO modify this if it doesn't work so as not to misrepresent.

$DV4.3Q5 -- s effaced before l,m,n,r -- so, sonorant consonants. 
$this also handles DV3.3A3 = DV1741A3 
$but this must come after DV2.3G3 and DV2.3I3 so as not to bleed their vowel-lengthening aspects. (if this is all more broadly conceived as vowel lengthening this could be of interest as it is also attested for Doric, Ionic and Attic)
$grouping this also with effective loss before "medial" d and dʰ implicated in Kortlandt 1987 -- 
$per Kortlandt 1987 p220 s5iii -- medial PIE *-sd(h)- (he seems to mean intervocalic for "medial") yielded the same reflex of *-d(h)- in -dh- (=/ð/) -- but the *s needs to be gone to feed this!

Inasmuch as this has to happen before that following s is about to be mutated, we're working with what De Vaan asserts the ancestor of θ to be at this time -- namely, the aforementioned affricate. Phonetically of course this compromise is suspect (the segment asserted by De Vaan, unlike the one being used as a proxy here, actually is a sibilant and a strident...) but that the details here can be worked on later.

$ notes Schumacher 2013 pp258-65 also as an "extensive discussion with partially different views" 
$ anyhow, for now, it seems this can be handled in much fewer than five rules -- just two, with the pre-tonic voicing being last, a development imposed on *ʃ, *ʃ itself being the "elsewhere outcome" of *s after the other rules impacting it have been applied

$ general rule for De Vaan(:1747) is no change in stress placement: by default, Latin loans have the same stress placement as in Classical Latin, "and the same goes for loanwords from later layers... Slavic, Italian... Greek... Turkish". Exceptions seem to be largely morphologically motivated (see bottom of p1747); De Vaan (1747) agrees with Matzinger 2006 that things are too complicated for Jokl 1923's treatment of PPAlb as having general penultimate accent. 

$DV1744.E2 not affecting Latin words, *intervocalic* *d to edh, perhaps with ability to see through r. (later change that DV'18 asserts affects Latin words too, has r not as optional but necessary, and is thus not intervocalic, with Latin intervocalic d being lost in Albanian in this account).

Some other sources do not have ujë "water" coming from something with an intervocalic *d though: Orel 1998 (:483) assets a PAlb *udrjā akin to Greek hydría "water bucket", in line with Camarda, Gil'ferding and Hamp 1965(:138); Huld 1976(:197) seems largely favorable to this and puts *udr-iom as his own form. Meyer 1891(:456) had *udni̯ā; Pedersen 1897(:286) and Tagliavini (1937:237) accept this but Huld 1976(:196) does not on the basis of the lack of any nasal traces in Arvanitika, a similar criticism to that voiced by Orel 1998. La Piana has ujë < ulë < ud-l-o. Demiraj 1997 (:401-2) asserts a PAlb *urjā citing Skt. vār- "water". Çabej 1967(:70-2) seems to say what De Vaan 2018 is saying here, except in that the -j- arises later in hiatus after the fall of intervocalic -d- in native words, which apparently Çabej 1967 considers more widespread than does De Vaan 2018 (?).

$DV2.2.1A1: PPAlb *i, unlike Latin i, reflects as PAlb *i without qualifications, as do PPAlb *ī and Latin ī (2.2.1A2,A6), but not Latin I, which reflects as PAlb *e generally (2.2.1B11) except when under i-mutation (2.2.1A5), wherein it behaves quite similarly to Latin E and PPAlb *e (2.2.1A3)
$The best way to handle this for now, without changing all the Latin inputs (but: note that based on Classical Latin and Romance phonology, these short I-s plausibly *could* be either [ɪ] or [e])... is to lengthen all PPAlb *i just before Latin.

$$|| Latin Input handling|| 
$  rules following here are not core aspects of De Vaan 2018's proposed rules, 
$	but they are necessary to get the right outcomes,
$	i.e. to prevent errors that are "uninteresting"
$	some are drawn from our knowledge of what was going on within Latin
$	they are certainly subject to inspection and possible critique
$	many are nonetheless clearly assumed by De Vaan 2018 in terms of how he treats the nature of the input to rules he does explicate

$ general rule for De Vaan(:1747) is no change in stress placement: by default, Latin loans have the same stress placement as in Classical Latin, "and the same goes for loanwords from later layers... Slavic, Italian... Greek... Turkish". Exceptions seem to be largely morphologically motivated (see bottom of p1747); De Vaan (1747) agrees with Matzinger 2006 that things are too complicated for Jokl 1923's treatment of PPAlb as having general penultimate accent. 

$DIACLEA CORRECTION A2.IX: pʰ > f, even if tʰ > t and kʰ > k
	$  Aromanian has shcl'ifur but Romanian has only palanga > pǎrângǎ (like Albanian also has p- in cognat plengë).

$ Deaspiration: this may or (more probably) may not have been contemporaneous with the merger of PIE aspirate voiced stops into

$per Kortlandt 1987 p220 s4 -- final s is deleted. This has to be after the dissimilations (thi for PIE ancestor of Lat. sūs) but before delabialization of ū, Kortlandt argues. De Vaan 2018 doesn't list this rule and asserts that nouns tend to reflect the accusative (which Bonnet 1998 seems to agree with), but this is included at this place (after the first Latin wave) to enable nominative forms in the lexicon as well as other words ending in -s, from Latin, Ancient Greek, and PIE alike. Note that Kortlandt 1987 opposes the view that *s went to *h or to ∅ (via /h/ or otherwise) in any other position (contra Jokl 1937, Meyer 1891, Pedersen 1900 , probably also Orel 2000), which includes retracting his earlier 1986 published view on intervocalic *s reflecting as nothing (but cf. nosom > nahe > na?). Given De Vaan 2018's reference to Kortlandt 1987 as its main source of *s developments, this view is adopted within this cascade, for now at least. (Kortlandt's lexical-etymological views are not adopted unless explicitly endorsed by De Vaan 2017, as with deriving the modern Albanian proximals ky,kjo,këta,këto from Latin ECCVM, also the source of these velar proximal elements across Romance)

$ by listing DIĀNA and GAVDIVM as having Latin -dj- and likewise -tj- for PUTEVS, VITIVM, PATIOR, and MARTIVS. However, this needs to 
$ be placed before the fates of intervocalic obstruents are handled, as De Vaan does not seem to treat words    like GAVDIVM as having

$ accuracy. Likewise these must also come before De Vaan 2018(: 1740)'s rules for Latin intervocalic /l/, as they feed the formation 
$ of PAlb *ʎ and *ɲ, and bleed the formation of *l:.

$part I of DV1736.G1 / DV2.2.1L1 has PPAlb ō and Lat ō, as well as Lat o, ultimately becoming *uo before word-final {ɫ,n,r,j}. For this to happen, the ō instances cannot be fronted to ø -- as will happen to long oː otherwise. At the same time, De Vaan does not list a *ɫ in Proto-Albanian or Proto-Albanian, though its sources are clear, coming from a PAlb *lː (DV1739~3.1E), itself with identifiable Pre-Proto-Albanian and Latin sources (DV1740~3.2F, cf. also -E). Makes sense to gather these as /lː/ for now, for the baseline cascade, before this rule. The *Rl aspect of it seems to come after consonantal reductionsː see De Vaan's listing of Latin PARABOLA > përrallë for DV1740~3.2F2. 
$note that this is not listed for the reflex of PPAlb *ā, which is currently *ɒː, but alas this item *does* get fronted to ø under i-mutation in DV2.2.1B7.
$TODO make sure the relevant rules concerning laterals are all placed before this! -- can remove when that is done. 
$What we need to do here: ensure that the relevant words can pass to *uo, and won't be bled by fronting to *ø, and we do this by effectively merging them into *ɒː, the reflex of PPAlb *ā. Use *lː for ɫ for now. Need to do this to o:, but not to short o.

$ DIACLEA CORRECTION B2.III -- bleeds nd > nt, so relocdated to just before it.

If this creates problems, another fix could be to make the j arising from hiatus into to a different element, perhaps a /ʝ/? As of June 24 2024, this is moved before i-mutation as well, because i-mutation has same patterning as yod-vowel coalescence, and i-mutation contexts literally cause a yod sometimes (eremus > jerm, lapathia > lëpjetë, (b/p)astica > bjeshkë, etc), but we never see (af-)frication in these contexts.

$ TODO try out the cluster simplificaiton aspects, and see then if they match what Orel said. 

$ effacements of intervocalic stops and /w/ follow (I'd note they were perhaps all phonetically fricatives at the time they were effaced, cf Pope 1934 on Latin /w/ as [ɣʷ], as noted in BaseCLEF) 

$ effacement of intervocalic /d/, per De Vaan 2018(: 1745 -- DV1745.A4) 
$	$ He asserts that native Proto-Albanian */d/ had a different fate in the same environment, 
	$	becoming /ð/ only after /d/ in Latin words was effaced, 
	$	with the same also occuring for both native and Latin /d/ in V__r (see De Vaan 2018: 1744)
	$ per p1745, he does explicitly propose that Latin intervocalic /d/ also became [ð] before disappearing, 
	$	but before this happened to native intervocalic /d/, and both in V r __ . 
	$ De Vaan 2018(: 1743) also explicitly asserts these passed trough a stage of *ð. 
$ $ note that this account is rival to Orel 2000(:105)'s view that Latin D shared the fate of Proto-Albanian *d in both V __ V and r __ Vs
$ $ The etyma cited by De Vaan 2018 as evidence for this are counterexplained 
	$ for gjyq, bekoj and jek -- by the view that voiced stops were effaced in secondary clusters caused by the internal vowel loss  
		$ cf. Bonnet 1998(:166) 
	$ and for fe and pre being counterexplained as possible later Angevin loans (Marr 2023) 
	$ counterexamples noted by Orel 2000, Bonnet 1998 and Marr 2023 include modh < MODVS, prodhoj < PRŌDĀRE, predhë < PRAEDA, adhuroj/adhëroj < ADŌRĀRE
$ possible other exceptions in the data: 
	$ other cases in the data : kudh (<(IN)CUDEM), kudhër (< INCUDINEM), perhaps predhë, also edh (<HAEDVS) perhaps;
		$  perhaps also medicastrum > mëgashtër may have had the -d- survive to motivate the voicing via progressive voicing assimilation . 
			$ likewise excaudic-ā- > shkaGoj
	$ there are cases where on the surface these appear to be properly effaced -- though it seems many are where vowel drops should be, in line with the views of Orel 2000 and Bonnet 1998 that the drop of /d/ (as well as /ɡ/ and /b/) is due to the clusters formed with fall of unstressed vowels 
	$ However in any case this clearly should be later if it happens at all, because (a) it is not seen in shared vocab with Romanian (padure, etc.), and more importantly (b) it is clear that cases that De Vaan doesn't seem to consider intervocalic -- laridum and viridim -- and which are unaffected (becoming lardh and verdh, respectively) -- thus, intervocalic stop effacement is moved to after vowel this based on DIA evidence, to allow DV1744.E4 to be fed first by internal vowel drops, and to allow them to bleed the -d- effacement after /r/ (and potentially feed it in other cases, if we go with the views of Orel 2000)

$------- continued rise of long vowels -------------
$DV1734.1.II -- long vowels that arise through contraction in final position with *-ë and -i, the latter with apparent fronting but while illustrated in provided examples this apparent fronting is not stated as part of the development by De Vaan 2018, because it can be handled anyways by i-mutation. Gheg preserves -aë# and -oë# longer and makes them into vowels in some dialects ([æ], [ø]), so this is placed after the split of Proto-Albanian 
$ this rule is formulated to capture not only non-primary stressed i and ə but also e -- this is simpler and has no issues as far as I'm aware -- TODO examine this for errors if necessary though.

$ although nasalizations of ỹ, õ are not explicit, they are not explicitly excluded either, and it is simpler in terms of rule formation to include them. TODO reexamine this in case it may cause problems.
$ DIACLEA CORRECTION: this also seems to happen word finally, including after uo̯ (though cases of uon don't seem to show any sign of overt nasalization *anywhere* unless I'm missing something -- so point at which it is deleted in Gheg there may need to be ascertained). 
$ [+syl] > [+nas] / __ [+nas,+cons] -- BaseCLEA18 version
[-cons] > [+nas] / __ [+nas,+cons]

$ Nasal vowel + nasal consonants become simple nasal vowels at some point. This does not seem to be explicated by De Vaan 2018, but it is implicit in some examples -- gju / Gheg gjû < glun-; Gheg lĩ < līnum, fqĩ < vicīnum, frẽ < frenum. Native vocab also show a pre-sibilant coalescence (mëz/mãz, pesë/pẽsë -- unclear if that z is still an affricate or not, so just do this in terms of stridents?). So we insert that here for now. These all concern only n, so only n is used in the formulation of this rule. Given the case of ftua < cotoneum one can generously allow this to happen not just for syllabics but also after nasalized glides, or glides after a nasal vowle (however uo's nasalized incarnation ends up being realized here, it is intended to be captured with this following rule formulation) 
$ DIACLEA TODO NOTE: after uo and perhpas a, this does not happen word finally in monosyllabic words... but there are only two examples luan and plënd. IF intend to implement it this way, use: 
	$n > ∅ / [+syl,+nas] __ #

$DV3.1A2 -- "PAlb. β" to m before "VN$". 
$Some ambiguity of dating of this rule -- this is placed between Proto-Albanian and modern Albanian, but the wording of this rule assumes beta has emerged but has not yet passed to /v/ (all the cases listed are where beta reflects Latin /w/), and it also assumes the /n/ is still present in this ve:nsi:ca despite nasal-spirant stuff that happened quite early... unless this word was loaned in another wave? Some examination may be necessary.
$Syllable break handled with a consonant for now. This may need to be examined but has no issues at present.

$DV4.1V3 -- lk > jk -- some variation (bujk/ bulk for "peasant", OAlb attests ulk) but seems (??) pan-Albanian in nature? 
$$ dialectal evidence suggests that this originally first passed to ʎ: Huld 1976 p 197 for ujk shows that uʎk- forms in Arvanitika and Arbereshe (Sal, Vacc, Falc), and Huld reasonably asserts proto-Albanian had either or uʎk- or ulk- when it split. This is perfectly compatible with hte rest of De Vaan 2018 (which has ʎ go to j later), and is not a new conclusion, so the version supported by Huld is implemented here for now.

$DV4.1E2 & DV4.1F2 -- iotation of l after velar stops. This does not occur in some southern varieties, such as Cham and some Arbereshe dialects, so it could be that it occurred after Proto-Tosk split (in the broad sense, i.e. Proto-Southern-Albanian), or that Proto-Southern-Tosk retracted *ʎ to *l after velar stops. The outcome in Arvanitika is ʎ; in Arvanitika (and the other varieties where ʎ occurs after velars?), ʎ elsewhere appears to be preserved -- cf.
