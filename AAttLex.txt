$(assumed) or explicit ATTIC(/Ionic) largely from Huld and others below [assumed if not otherwise indicated, for Ancient Greek loanas.]
b r ˈoː t a k o n , b ɾ ˈɛ t ə k , b ɾ ˈɛ t k $frog. Romanian broatec. Vatasescu 1997: 219. OAlb bretëk. However Greek form seems to have short o: βροτάχος . Not in Beekes apparently. 
d ˈe p o n , >* , d j ˈɛ p $cradle. Orel 1998: 68. Cabej St. I 129-30, Etim III 264-5 (apud Orel) instead has AGk depas from Proto-Albanian. -a to -on per gender. "Pre-Greek" for Beekes EDG 317. 
ɦ ˌaː ˈe r a , >* , ˈɛ ɾ ə $erë, meaning wind, smell. Bonnet 1998: 135 as from an {accusative?} Gk aera. Some argue it is native. Hamp apud Brian Joseph personal communication, also Hyllested and Joseph 2022, via Winters' lawː odro -- see APIElex. Or a later borrowing from Romance -- cf Orel 1998: 89. Matasovic 2024: 61. If this is a Greek loan it has to be from Attic or Ionic -- later Ionic has ɛːɛ́ːr; Aeolic aú,ɛ́ːr, ,Doric au.ɛ́ːr "aβɛ́ːr" -- Beekes EDG 27. 
ɦ ˌa j ɟ a l ˈo s , >* , z ˈa lˠ $river sand, river bank. haigialós. Orel 1998: 519. Myc. a₃-ki-a₂-ri-jo /aigihalio-/; also Aigialeis, inhabitants of coast of Achaea-- Beekes EDG 31, who thinks pre-Greek; in any case Doric is quite possible as well here.  Cabej instead as native from IE *yelo.
$ REJECTED in favor of native etymology ɦ ˈe n tʰ ˌeː m a j , >* , ˈɛ n d ɛ m $roam/weave.pres.medpass.indic. hentheimai. Demiraj 1997: 88. Cabej II 161 (apud Orel 1998: 88) connects it to apparent Illyrian (spirit) άνδινος).  May be native. 
ɦ ˈɛː r e m o n ,  j ˈɛ ɾ ə m ,  j ˈɛ ɾ m $wilderness. OAlb jerëm. Treatment as from hˈɛːremon instead of its Latin loan ɛː r e m u m , into Archaic P-Alb or Classical P-Alb, but this seems to work. Latin form eré(ː)mus does not seem to be reflected in initial stress here. Greek had both an initial stressed version hɛ́ːremos and a penult stressed version herêmos. The related jeremí "hermit" is difficult. Vatasescu 1997: 455. Form ɛ̄rɛmos "tranquil" -- Beekes EDG 525 -- seems to reflect a *h₁remH- "rest, be quiet"; whether this is East Greek on basis of ɛ̄- not secure, could easily just be lengthened grade? 
$rejected in favor of reikia ɦ ˌe r ˈeː k ɛː n , >* , ɾ ˈi c ɛ $brier. May instead be NGk reikia, also considered in MGrALex. Orel 1998: 372. 
$h ˈo i ɛː , >* , v ˈa ð ə $Cabej St. II 258-9 to oα; Demiraj 1997: 411 to Byz oa too. Orel 1998: 492. Very, very bizarre; claimed j > dh. TODO reconsider chronology -- REMOVED. etymology rejected. 
$REJECTED ETYMOLOGY k ˈa n n i n , c ˈɛ̃ː , c ˈə $round kneading board. Gheg qê. Orel 1998: 359. Wasmer apud Orel has it from a Romance *clāvanus < Lat clāva "stick", Meyer 1893: 224-5 apud Orel 1998 has it from a PIE;  but Cham që challenges both of these; perhaps it is a loan. Çabej relates it in some way to Celtic, cf. Breton kant. TODO reconsider. TODO singularized plural < kanniː? Changed from -a to -in; plural? See forms in Beekes EDG 636 -- likely pre-Greek.  
k ˈɑ n tʰ ɑ r o n , k ˈã n t ə ɾ ə , k ˈə n d ə ɾ $insect. Per Topalli 2017(:709), Cabej 1982 I: 263-4. -- actually from Ancient Greek kántharos, "dung beetle" -- Beekes EDG 634. Per Orel, from Latin cantharis (acc. -idem). Beekes EDG 634-5 -- not well explained in Greek itself. Nothing clearly mandating this one be specifically Attic.
$ REJECTED k ɑ n tʰ ˈɑ r i o n , >* , k ˈa n d ə ɾ $type of vessel. Cf attested kanthárion in an Attic inscr -- Beekes EDG 634.
k ˌa p n ˈo n , >* , k ˈa m $incense. Now singulativized plural in kem/qem. Cabej St. VII 281. Jokl has it as compound instead in *kwep but this should give *s-. Orel 1998: 356. nothing mandating this be specifically Attic. Mycenean ka-pi-ni-ja. Internal Greek reconstruction from PIE here is "improbable" though -- Beekes EDG 638-9.
k ˌe r a s ˈiː a , >* , c ɛ ɾ ʃ ˈi $cherry. k ˈe r a s o n , c ˈɛ ɾ ʃ $cherry; now qersh-í. Camarda {apud} Orel 1998: 358, Bonnet 1998: 334 -- attribute it to Greek, perhaps due to the accentation, but {later?} Greek actually has antepenultimate stress on the a in kerasion (modern kerˈasi). While the base word in Greek is kérasos {att'd n Mycenean ke-ra-so:}, an appopriate source is seen in attested forms kerasía "bird cherry" whih is also found as ceraséa; all of these reflect a loan from Anatolic -- Beekes EDG 677. Does not have to be specifically Attic. Others attribute it to Latin or Romance cerasium, cerasus etc -- Meyer 1891: 22. Cf also Çabej 1962: 183, 1982: 263, apud Vățășescu 1997: 166. Cf Romanian cireașă (-> Blg cheresha), Aromanian cireashă, cireashi, Basque gerezi, West Gmc *kirsija, Celtic *keresya, Ligurian çêxa etc. Rival etymology in ALLAPS of MPA I entry currently commented out as of late Dec '25. 
k ˌo k k ˈu m ɛː l o n , >* , k ˈu m b u lˠ $plum. Is this an Attic kokkumɛ̄lon? No -ā- listd in Beekes EDG 733; other forms list is as with -e-, oddly. Moved from Doric to Attic -- works better as Attic, actually; i-mutation is actually regularly bled here. Tentative to actually have this one as Attic, as it feeds -b- excrescence better. 
l ˈa kʰ a n o n , l ˈa k ə ɾ̃ ə , l ˈa k ə ɾ $cabbage, lettuce. Orel 2000(:23, 102), Huld 1986(:250). Citation form lakhaino is actually secondary result of backformation; likely from substrate -- Beekes 2010: 839. Attic not specifically mandated.  Cf also lakkha a loan from Prakr apparently -- Beekes EDG 827. 
l ˌe k ˈa n ɛː n , l ə k ˈæ̃ n , l i c ˈɛ n $lake. Hyllested and Joseph 2022: 14. Vatasescu 1997: 149. If hte -ɛ̄ reflects ā this has to be East Greek, but no such -ā form listed in Beekes EDG 847. 
l ˈuː m a , >* , l ˈy m ə $dirt. Orel 1998: 236. Final -a to schwa will ultimately be removed because masculine.
m ˈa n ɡ a n o n , m ˈã ŋ ɡ ə ɾ̃ ə , m ˈə ŋ ɡ ə ɾ $oil-press, roller. Gheg mangën. Orel 1998: 261. TODO May be from MGk mánganon instead? Vățășescu 1997: 57. No reason to assume specifically Attic. 
m ˌa n ˈiː a , m ə ɾ̃ ˈi , m ə ɾ ˈi $anger. Orel 1998: 262. Gheg mëni, verb mërij "to hate". Old Alb mëni and mëri attested. Romanian mânie. Vatasescu 1997: 56. Moved to Greek layer, considering stress pattern, tho not listed in Beekes. 
m ˌa s t ˈi kʰ i n o n , >* , m ə ʃ t ˈɛ k ə ɾ $birch. Romanian meseacăn. Gheg mështekën. Per Cabej St. I 349, apud Orel 1998: 264, who instead supports a Latin origin for this. Vățășescu 1997: 163. Orel 2000: 56; Bonnet 382 as mështker. Rejected Latin -- Greek works better. 
m ˈi t a , >* , m j ˈɛ t ə $thread of the woof. Orel 1998: 270. TODO check Cabej St. I 352, may be better explained. Og m ˈi t o n , changed to -a because feminine. No clear reason to limit it to Attic. 
pʰ ˌɑ l ˈɑ n ɡ ɑ , >* , p l ˈɛ ŋ ɡ ə $catapult. Orel 1998: 333. Romanian părângă. Moved from Latin to Attic Greek layer. Explicitly seen in Attic, Doric, and Macedonian all three -- Beekes EDG 1548.
pʰ ˌɑ l ˈɑ n ɡ o n , >* , p l ˈɛ ŋ ɡ $heavy object. Same source as plengë, masculinized apparently? May need re-examination. Orel 1998: 333. Moved from Latin to Attic Greek layer. Explicitly seen in Attic, Doric, and Macedonian all three -- Beekes EDG 1548.
p ˈa w l a , >* , p ˈa lˠ ə $rest, quiet. Orel 1998: 310. TODO Or from NGk paula. 
p ˈe l a ɡ o n , p ˈɛ lˠ ə ɡ , p ˈɛ lˠ ɡ $puddle (< Gk 'sea'), via OAlb pellëg. Orel 1998(: 314). Doesn't need to be specifically Attic.
p ˌe r ˈa ɔː , >* , p ə r ˈu a̯ $brook; river bed. Cabej Demiraj 1997: 318 on word to 'penetrate', apud Orel 1998: 323. TODO is this a duplicate of a claimed Slavicism? Og. p ˌe r ˈa ɔː o, but Proto-Albanian doesn't have that level of hiatus craziness; lexically nativized. Perhaps too semantically adventurous. 
p r ˈa s o n , >* , p ɾ ˈɛ ʃ $leek. Orel 2000(:23, 102). From a plural prasi-? Doesn't need to be specifially Attic, clearly shows up in Attic, Ionic, Doric in Laconia -- Beekes EDG 1229, who also lists a prasios. 
s ˈa r k o n , >* , ʃ ˈa ɾ k $fruit pulp. Orel 1998: 408. Cabej St. II 128 instead to IE *sker- . Final -a to on because gender. Beekes EDG 1310. Not Aeolic syrkes, but other than that doens't have to be specifically Attic. 
$ REJECTED ETYMOLOGY s ˈe l p o n , >* , ʃ ˈɛ ɾ p $wild celery. TODO Alternatively, Latin sirpe. Orel 1998: 411. It's ins'teas sélīnon in Beekes EDG 1319, without any form like this. Removing. 
s k ˈa r i pʰ a , >* , ʃ k ˈa ɾ p ə $brushwood. Meyer attributes to Romance. Cabej St. VII 243 apud Orel 1998: 417. TODO consider. Og s k ˈa r i pʰ o n , changed to -a because feminine. Beekes EDG 1344.
s kʰ ˈiː n o n , >* , ʃ c ˈi n d $mastic-tree. Cabej St. II 151-2. Orel 1998: 434. Doesn't seem to be in Beekes. 
s p ˈa r o n , >* , ʃ p ˈa ɾ $golden bream. Now feminized with -ë it seems. Source of shpar-zë, perhaps not directly attested it seems... Çabej St. II 146 apud Orel 1998: 427. Beekes EDG 1376-7. 
s p ˈa r ɡ a n o n , ʃ p ˈa ɾ ɡ ə ɾ̃ ə , ʃ p ˈa ɾ ɡ ə ɾ $diaper. Gheg shpargën and shpërgâ. Cabej St. II 148 apud Orel 1998: 428. No clear reason it must be specifically Attic. Beekes EDG 1377.
s p ˈa r t a , >* , ʃ p ˈa ɾ t ə $arrow-jointed broom. Vatasescu 1997: 187. Many derivations thereof in Attic but doesn't have to be specifically from Atttic it seems -- Beekes EDG 1377.
s p ˈɛː l a i a , >* , ʃ p ˈɛ lˠ ə $hole, grotto. Huld 1986(:250) as Attic (unlike other cases like mokër). Topalli 2017(ː1409) supports this as do some others (see Orel 1998(ː428)); Orel 1998(ː428) sees this instead as via Latin spelaeum however. OG -on, changed to -a because feminine. Beekes EDG 1382.  spel- root, therefore doesn't have to be specfically Attic; Beekes insists it is "no doubt" pre-Greek.
$s p ˈo n ɡ i a , >* , ʃ p ˈu z ə $seasponge. Vatasescu 1997: 218. Romanian spânz? Consider input g as ɟ below.

s ˌy r ˈi t t i oː , >* , ʃ ə ɾ ˈi s $to whistle. Orël 1998: 413. Gk syrizdo, dial. syritto. TODO PROPOSAL currently going with the idea of this being integrated into Vtio verb class. Now reduplicated shëshëris.  
t ˈe r m o n , >* , c ˈɛ ɾ m $raised baulk, higher part of campfire. Haarmann has it from Latin termen, terminus instead. Orel 1998: 358. Cf. Cabej St. II 60 too perhaps -- may be cognate with both of these? -a to -on because gender. Vatasescu 1997(: 355) lists it as Gheg. Cabej 1962(:182) notes Latin but also doesn't exclude an Old Greek origin. Could be native, technically termos? 
t r ˌɑ n t ˈɑ f y l l ɔ n , >* , t ɾ ə n d a f ˈi l $rose. TODO FIND CITATION. Rom. trandafil, Arom trandafira. Byz Greek stressed on antepenult: τριαντάφυλλο. However, the Greek is from τριάντα 'thirty' + φύλλον 'leaf' so stress on the 'i may not be crazy. PROPOSAL that this is a loan into CPA to explain stress placement onto the penult. TODO examine.  Romanian trandafir suggestes the tria was tra here {tentative}
