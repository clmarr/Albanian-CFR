Exceptions seem to be largely morphologically motivated (see bottom of p1747); De Vaan (1747) agrees with Matzinger 2006 that things are too complicated for Jokl 1923's treatment of PPAlb as having general penultimate accent. 

$ Deaspiration: this may or (more probably) may not have been contemporaneous with the merger of PIE aspirate voiced stops into

$$ De Vaan 2018 has the change in vowel length to quality only come after major PPAlb to PAlb developments -- see p1736 -- namely long round vowel fronting, ai > ē, and aː > ɔː. -- will be handled in next stage

$ gliding of unstressed /i/ and /e/ in hiatus with a following vowel to [j] -- cf. Pope 1934 s220. This is attested early but not 
$ trivially early -- it is in the Appendix Probi, as Pope 1934(:s220) notes. De Vaan 2018(:1744) seems to implicate this had occurred 
$ by listing DIĀNA and GAVDIVM as having Latin -dj- and likewise -tj- for PUTEVS, VITIVM, PATIOR, and MARTIVS. However, this needs to 
$ be placed before the fates of intervocalic obstruents are handled, as De Vaan does not seem to treat words like GAVDIVM as having 
$ intervocalic -d-, for example, and this does clearly bleed his proposed rules for intervocalic /d/ in particular, if we assume its 
$ accuracy. Likewise these must also come before De Vaan 2018(: 1740)'s rules for Latin intervocalic /l/, as they feed the formation 
$ of PAlb *ʎ and *ɲ, and bleed the formation of *l:.  
$ for convenience, and given Pope 1934(:s220), and given that forming a broad rule is trivial here, the same is done for /u/ and /o/.

	$	with the same also occuring for both native and Latin /d/ in V__r (see De Vaan 2018: 1744)
	$ per p1745, he does explicitly propose that Latin intervocalic /d/ also became [ð] before disappearing,

	$ De Vaan 2018(: 1743) also explicitly asserts these passed trough a stage of *ð.
