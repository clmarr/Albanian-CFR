$from De Vaan 1738-9, order may need to be revised. 
$for now, (somewhat arbitrarily) coding laryngeals as specific sounds 
	$ since we can't handle h1 h2 h3 etc. -- or otherwise we'd have to define these in symbolDefs
$choose features closest to their coloring vowel . 
$ h for h1 -- no coloring effect negative for all feats (except cont.)	(or use ʔ ?) 
$ ħ for h2 -- -front +back -round -hi +lo --like a  
$ χʷ for h3 -- -front +back +round -hi -lo -- like o 
	$ TODO reconsider this, considering that APIELex has x χ and xʷ respectively for laryngeals 1 2 and 3
$ h2 and h3 can be minimally captured as +back,+cont
$ the three together can be captured for now as -cor,-son,+cont (unless we make h1 ʔ -- this is an argument not to) -- until any *f is developed. 
$ (x for Hamp's h4 if we need it? ) (or use h and make h1 ʔ ?) 	(or could use ? or h4) 
$ using j for i̯ and w for u̯
$ for the palatovelars : c ɟ ɟʰ
$ *a as it emerges is [ɑ], as this is ħ is closest to.

$DV1738~2.3C1 part 1, *e > *a ( really ɑ ) after *h2. Nothing listed for *h3 here. 
$ so most faithful formulation would be : [-hi,-round] > [+lo] / ħ __
$ but inasmuch as laryngeal vowel coloring is a widely accepted broad phenomenon of laryngeal-coloring within PIE, it is formulated explicitly in the way it is thought to work across branches; likewise it is expanded to include coloring by posterior laryngeals as well 
$ ultimately this is part of the implementation of the following: 
$   in the progressive coloring aspect: DV2.3C2, 2.3E2, 2.3F1, 2.3J2, 2.3K2
$   in the regressive coloring aspect: DV2.3E2, 2.3F1, 2.3G2, 2.3H1, 2.3J2, 2.3K2
[-hi,-lo,-round] > [βlo,ɣround,ðback,ɛfront] / [-cor,-son,+cont,βlo,ɣround,ðback,ɛfront] __
[-hi,-lo,-round] > [βlo,ɣround,ðback,ɛfront] / __ [-cor,-son,+cont,βlo,ɣround,ðback,ɛfront]

$DV1738~2.3C3 -- "*a < RHV" -- not sure I interpreted this right, he gives pare "first" as example; given the etymology in pr̩-h2-e/o I think he rather is intending for the R to pass to aR (...?), rather than it all to be absorbed into an *a which would be the literal interpretation of "RHV > a" by the system. 
$ this needs to be before 2.3A2 in order to get this effect for parë "first", so that is implemented. (also likely necessary to come before  the H-loss aspect of 2.3B1, 2.3C1, 2.3C2, 2.3E2 and 2.3F1, but this aspect of each will probably instead be handled by 1746.K4) 
$ Formulated so as to preserve maximal stress

∅ > ɑ / __ [+cons,+syl] [-cor,-son,+cont] [+syl] 
ɑ [+cons,βstres,ɣprim] > [βstres,ɣprim] [-syl] 

$Per general understanding of laryngeal behavior, laryngeals efface and lengthen prior vowels (after coloring them) when before consonants or the word boundary. This is touched upon in various DV'18 rules as an aspect, with each rule effectively handling the effacement of hte laryngeal and the ensuing prior vowel lengthening separately in parallel: 2.3E, 2.3G1, 2.3G2, 2.3H1, 2.3I1 -- but inspection of all the examples given show that while this is not explicated, all these VH cases are VHC or VH#, which is in line with the broad understanding of how this phenomenon occured across most core IE branches. 
$rules that are essentially accomplished here: the *iH > *i: aspect of 2.3E, 2.3F2 (fed by laryngeal vowel coloring), 2.3G1's eh1 > ē aspecet, 2.3H1's oH and eh3 aspects (the latter fed by laryngeal vowel coloring)
[+syl] [-cor,-son,+cont] > [+long] ∅ / __ {[+cons];#}

$DV1738~2.3C4 -- *h2 and *h3 become *a before syllabic resonants. Reformulated here so that stress is preserved and the resonants lose resonance in a single rule. 
$this may actually be multiple phenomena, with a later *o created by this rule or other phenommena involving h3 later merging to *a, but it's handled as one phenomenon by De Vaan 2018 it seems. It is actually simpler to let h3 pass to *o here and then become *a via 2.3C1 here though, so that's what this cascade does. 
$maximally faithful form without doing this would be: [+back,+cont] [+syl,+cons,βstres,ɣprim] > [+lo,-hi,-round,+tense,+voi,-strid,βstres,ɣprim] [-syl]
$based on the case of arë "field" given as an example, it seems this is not intended to be bled by DV2.3A1, so it is placed before it. 
[+back,+cont,+cons] [+syl,+cons,βstres,ɣprim] > [βstres,ɣprim,+tense,+voi,-strid] [-syl]

$PREVOCALIC LARYNGEAL EFFACEMENT: per general understanding of laryngeal behavior in late PIE as it differentiated (but which is generally understood to be all IE except Anatolian?), prevocalic laryngeals are now effaced.
$This is implicit in (and thus implements aspects of) the rules DV2.3B1 (actually in this case it's the whole rule), DV2.3C1, DV2.3C2 (the other aspect being the abovehandled laryngeal vowel-coloring), 2.3E2, 2.3F1, 2.3J2 (the rest handled by laryngeal vowel-coloring), 2.3K2 (as above)

$DV1738~2.3C9 calls for insertion of PPAlb a (really ɑ) in between two consonants, but if interpreted to be deterministic this would cause massive errors. The given example is madh "big" < *m̥ĝ, but De Vaan 2018 hedges here, noting that Schumacher 2013(: 238) instead explains this item via analogy. Thus this is not implemented for now. 

$DV1738~2.3C1 : PIE *(H)o > *a	(really ɑ)

$DV4.3I3 -- *Tt > *tʃ too. The single example pot-to is a dental stop; to resolve conflict between this rule and DV4.3Q3, I refer to the examples given by De Vaan 2018 in the latter, and these include -pt-, -ct-, and -kʷt- but on dentals. Given the past literature on the "thorn cluster", it makes sense to assume that this one targets a dental cluster, and effacement rule in DV4.3Q3 which would naturally compete with this, is place-independent and comes later -- in effect targeting non-dental stop

$per Kortlandt 1987 p220 s5iii -- medial PIE *-sd(h)- (he seems to mean intervocalic for "medial") yielded the same reflex of *-d(h)- in -dh- (=/ð/) -- but the *s needs to be gone to feed this!

Inasmuch as this has to happen before that following s is about to be mutated, we're working with what De Vaan asserts the ancestor of θ to be at this time -- namely, the aforementioned affricate.

$ notes Schumacher 2013 pp258-65 also as an "extensive discussion with partially different views" 
$ anyhow, for now, it seems this can be handled in much fewer than five rules -- just two, with the pre-tonic voicing being last, a development imposed on *ʃ, *ʃ itself being the "elsewhere outcome" of *s after the other rules impacting it have been applied

$DV1744.E2 not affecting Latin words, *intervocalic* *d to edh, perhaps with ability to see through r.

Meyer 1891(:456) had *udni̯ā; Pedersen 1897(:286) and Tagliavini (1937:237) accept this but Huld 1976(:196) does not on the basis of the lack of any nasal traces in Arvanitika, a similar criticism to that voiced by Orel 1998. La Piana has ujë < ulë < ud-l-o. Demiraj 1997 (:401-2) asserts a PAlb *urjā citing Skt. vār- "water". Çabej 1967(:70-2) seems to say what De Vaan 2018 is saying here, except in that the -j- arises later in hiatus after the fall of intervocalic -d- in native words, which apparently Çabej 1967 considers more widespread than does De Vaan 2018 (?).

$$|| Latin Input handling|| 
$  rules following here are not core aspects of De Vaan 2018's proposed rules, 
$	but they are necessary to get the right outcomes,
$	i.e. to prevent errors that are "uninteresting"
$	some are drawn from our knowledge of what was going on within Latin
$	they are certainly subject to inspection and possible critique
$	many are nonetheless clearly assumed by De Vaan 2018 in terms of how he treats the nature of the input to rules he does explicate

$ general rule for De Vaan(:1747) is no change in stress placement: by default, Latin loans have the same stress placement as in Classical Latin, "and the same goes for loanwords from later layers... Slavic, Italian... Greek... Turkish". Exceptions seem to be largely morphologically motivated (see bottom of p1747); De Vaan (1747) agrees with Matzinger 2006 that things are too complicated for Jokl 1923's treatment of PPAlb as having general penultimate accent. 

$DIACLEA CORRECTION A2.IX: pʰ > f, even if tʰ > t and kʰ > k
	$  Aromanian has shcl'ifur but Romanian has only palanga > pǎrângǎ (like Albanian also has p- in cognat plengë). 
pʰ > f

$ Greek 'y' becomes i, likewise for the long-variant (praebyter > prift, etc... however there may be some exceptions: khylus > Alb. qull vs. Romanian cir. (The case of qipër/qypër, however, is probably secondary, and for hte same reasons as shqip/shqyp -- rounding in some Gheg dialects in (at least) [c] __ [p] ) 
[+front,+syl] > [-round,-lab]

$ g before n is ŋ -- Pope 1934(: p75 s158, p133 s321); Allen 1978 p23; Lloyd 1987 p81)
$ not made explicit by De Vaan -- henceforth Latin ɡn as discussed by him can be assumed to represent ŋn. In Romanian these clusters (later) become mn or m- (agnellus > miel, signum > semn, cognatus > cumnat...), but for Albanian De Vaan later assigns these as going to /ɲ/. 
ɡ > ŋ / __ n

$ Latin(-internal?) NASAL FRICATIVE PHENOMENON : Latin nasals lost before fricatives, making a prior vowel long if there was a prior V. 
	$ an input assumption for DV1735.D4. wrt krushk "in-law" < CONSOCER 
	$ some assert these long V-s would have gone through a stage of nasality for the vowels, but De Vaan does not consider this 
		$ relevant for Albanian outcomes
		$ inquiry into whether occasional Gheg nasality in these places (there are some 20-30 relevant words, at least can be systematically handled would be interesting -- it seems generally they are not nasalized) 
	$ cf Pope 1934 s359 (as a "very early" phenomenon in Latin), also p73 s156ii; also Allen 1978(:27-31, 55-6). 
		$ Shared with Romanian apparently. 
		$ Per Allen, Vaananen etc 
	$ different handling in corresponding Orel 1.4.7.13 on p115 in ns > ʃ
	$ this should not be formulated and sequenced so as to be fed by De Vaan 2018's one step passage of his PPAlb *tɕ *dʝ > *θ *ð, so that is placed afterward  (just because this is not indicated -- if there is evidence for it this would merit a change in treatment)
$DIACLEA CORRECTION B1.I: moved this to after the pre-penultimate o/o:>u phenomena. As of June 17 -- reverted, returned to normal position.

$ DIACLEA CORRECTION A2.IV. Latin -ˈVolV(C)# items shift the stress onto the -o-, even though it is short. This is actually seen in the Romance languages too it seems (Seen in modiolus, filiolus, caveola, capreolus, phaseolus, gladiolus, etc...)   so it is placed into Latin input handling.

$per Kortlandt 1987 p220 s4 -- final s is deleted. This has to be after the dissimilations (thi for PIE ancestor of Lat. sūs) but before delabialization of ū, Kortlandt argues. De Vaan 2018 doesn't list this rule and asserts that nouns tend to reflect the accusative (which Bonnet 1998 seems to agree with), but this is included at this place (after the first Latin wave) to enable nominative forms in the lexicon as well as other words ending in -s, from Latin, Ancient Greek, and PIE alike. Note that Kortlandt 1987 opposes the view that *s went to *h or to ∅ (via /h/ or otherwise) in any other position (contra Jokl 1937, Meyer 1891, Pedersen 1900 , probably also Orel 2000), which includes retracting his earlier 1986 published view on intervocalic *s reflecting as nothing (but cf. nosom > nahe > na?). Given De Vaan 2018's reference to Kortlandt 1987 as its main source of *s developments, this view is adopted within this cascade, for now at least. (Kortlandt's lexical-etymological views are not adopted unless explicitly endorsed by De Vaan 2017, as with deriving the modern Albanian proximals ky,kjo,këta,këto from Latin ECCVM, also the source of these velar proximal elements across Romance) 
$ ʃ and s both included to allow flexibility in place

$ symbol defs and the IPA don't (most typically) use *tɕ *dʝ, these are expressed with c͡ç and ɟ͡ʝ for reasons discussed above in the formulation for DV4.3G1 & H1 
$ needs to come after the nasal-spirant law in Latin input handling so as not to feed it. 
$ However, in light of the fact that Proto-Albanian loans reflecting PIE palatovelars reflect as ts dz in Aromanian and various ts s z in Romanian (unlike PAlb ð < PPAlb *d, which reflects with d in Romanian and Aromanian), this is indeed split in two, with the affricate stage first, and the spirantization only after Middle Proto-Albanian (when De Vaan assigns the contact between Proto-Albanian and Proto-Vlach)

$ TODO does seem to happen after aw > a, so consider either relocdating that earlier into the end of Classical Proto-Albanian, or moving this -- and the relevant vowel drops -- later...
$ results when the /i/ is stressed are unclear -- which is why this is a "maybe metathesis" rule
	$ if it is really metathesis, we should see -ní(jë), with the n possibly going to -r- in Tosk when conditioned. This is possible what we see in porrˈīna > *porrinˈiːa > purri(-a) and maybe its possible variant prijë. But prijë could also be explained as coming from a prinjë, which matches the non-metathesis scenario that seems evident in marruːcˈiːna > mërqinjë, where it seems the original i maintains its stress, rather than switching with the n (along with the insertion of an i before the n). On the other hand columbīna > kullumbrí is a clear case of what looks more like metathesis. Seeing as -injë is a rather common suffix, it's possible merqinjë was analogized, so we are going with the -metathesis scenario for now -- that is (ˈ)ina > in(ˈ)ia, not (ˈ)ina > (ˈ)inia
	$ inasmuch as ia > e is plausible for Romanian, may also be evident in Romanian and Aromanian (?) -- marrucina > Alb mërqinjë, Romanian mărăcine (albeit also mărăcină), Aromanian mărăține. Alas this rule may not be worth it at all...

$$ De Vaan 2018 has the change in vowel length to quality only come after major PPAlb to PAlb developments -- see p1736 -- namely long round vowel fronting, ai > ē, and aː > ɔː. -- will be handled in next stage

$ GLIDING -- gliding of unstressed /i/ and /e/ in hiatus with a following vowel to [j] -- cf. Pope 1934 s220. This is attested early but not trivially early -- it is in the Appendix Probi, as Pope 1934(:s220) notes. De Vaan 2018(:1744) seems to implicate this had occurred 
$ by listing DIĀNA and GAVDIVM as having Latin -dj- and likewise -tj- for PUTEVS, VITIVM, PATIOR, and MARTIVS. However, this needs to 
$ be placed before the fates of intervocalic obstruents are handled, as De Vaan does not seem to treat words    like GAVDIVM as having 
$ intervocalic -d-, for example, and this does clearly bleed his proposed rules for intervocalic /d/ in particular, if we assume its 
$ accuracy. Likewise these must also come before De Vaan 2018(: 1740)'s rules for Latin intervocalic /l/, as they feed the formation 
$ of PAlb *ʎ and *ɲ, and bleed the formation of *l:.  
$ for convenience, and given Pope 1934(:s220), and given that forming a broad rule is trivial here, the same is done for /u/ and /o/. 
	$ inasmuch as Latin orthographic V was used for both, there is perhaps mild support for De Vaan 2018 also having this here,

$DIACLEA CORRECTION A2.XI: aw-mutation? rounding and lowering of primary stressed unrounded long/tense (a:, o:, e:) vowels under the influence of a round vowel on the other side of an ɲ. As of Jan 28, 2025, this is expanded to also operate across n (iānua > ... > gjua) and rj (qershuar, fëruor etc), with deletion of the j. Unified by features -- these are consonantal sonorants (as it turns out, l ʎ m don't occur in  the right positions to trigger thisǃ So can just leave with two feature spec.). Jan 28 2025 -- also realized that +tense was not necessary. 
$ inclusion of ō is unclear -- evidence does not point strongly either way. Excluding it would mean more conditions though. 
$ operation on ē does not happen after dentals and perhaps not after l-velar sequences (plac-ē- > pëlqej, indulg-ē- ndjej, perindulg- përdëllej; lk uncertain given plac-ē> pëlqej but mulc-ē > mëlkoj, mulkoj, but without pëlqej; one other issue is poenitere > pend-o- though this is only seen today in the reflexive pendohem and maybe it wouldn't apply given the different suffix in that case?). For now, for the sake of simplicity, just go with the coronal; for all we know, perhaps Alb. pëlqej is actually a cognate, not a reflex, of Latin placeo/placēre (the word apparently also exists in Tocharian)
	$ these same post coronal environments do see some -ej outcomes for the -ā- class too (simul-ā- > shëmbëllej, incausin-ā- > ngashërej, sper-ā- > shpërej ...) but only in 7 out of 76 cases.
$ During August 2023 it was thought that ɲ also depalatalized after original ō here but in further consideration, only two items are affected (antōnius, cotōneum) and these were able to be explained otherwise in a much more general rule conditioned by nasals, so this was removed on the 29th
$ January 28, 2025 -- moved into Middle Proto-Albanian I period -- some evidence Romanian is also implicated in related changes that postdate this. Placed just before nj > ɲ, so that r and n can be unified easily.

$ the vowel reduction and falls as a whole are said to happen "in the last phase of the Proto-Albanian period... after i-mutation and a-mutation" but it seems this does not apply to these early internal post-tonic reductions given the cited cases of lardh and verdh, nor to the internal pretonic vowels that are reduced to ə and/or "lost at a stage preceding PAlb" (with Latin etyma cited -- cotoneus > ftua, nepōtia > mbesë, etc.); note that APA is not strictly within De Vaan's "PAlb here".

If this creates problems, another fix could be to make the j arising from hiatus into to a different element, perhaps a /ʝ/? As of June 24 2024, this is moved before i-mutation as well, because i-mutation has same patterning as yod-vowel coalescence, and i-mutation contexts literally cause a yod sometimes (eremus > jerm, lapathia > lëpjetë, (b/p)astica > bjeshkë, etc), but we never see (af-)frication in these contexts. Note that this can be the case in Christian vocab where (af-)fricatoin does not occur ː  christiān-u [kristjan-ʊ] > kërshter-ë.

	$	with the same also occuring for both native and Latin /d/ in V__r (see De Vaan 2018: 1744)
	$ per p1745, he does explicitly propose that Latin intervocalic /d/ also became [ð] before disappearing, 
	$	but before this happened to native intervocalic /d/, and both in V r __ . 
	$ De Vaan 2018(: 1743) also explicitly asserts these passed trough a stage of *ð. 
$ $ note that this account is rival to Orel 2000(:105)'s view that Latin D shared the fate of Proto-Albanian *d in both V __ V and r __ Vs
$ $ The etyma cited by De Vaan 2018 as evidence for this are counterexplained 
	$ for gjyq, bekoj and jek -- by the view that voiced stops were effaced in secondary clusters caused by the internal vowel loss  
		$ cf. Bonnet 1998(:166) 
	$ and for fe and pre being counterexplained as possible later Angevin loans (Marr 2023)

		$  perhaps also medicastrum > mëgashtër may have had the -d- survive to motivate the voicing via progressive voicing assimilation .

$ Nasal vowel + nasal consonants become simple nasal vowels at some point. This does not seem to be explicated by De Vaan 2018, but it is implicit in some examples -- gju / Gheg gjû < glun-; Gheg lĩ < līnum, fqĩ < vicīnum, frẽ < frenum. Native vocab also show a pre-sibilant coalescence (mëz/mãz, pesë/pẽsë -- unclear if that z is still an affricate or not, so just do this in terms of stridents?). So we insert that here for now. These all concern only n, so only n is used in the formulation of this rule. Given the case of ftua < cotoneum one can generously allow this to happen not just for syllabics but also after nasalized glides, or glides after a nasal vowel (however uo's nasalized incarnation ends up being realized here, it is intended to be captured with this following rule formulation)
