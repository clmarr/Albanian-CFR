pjesë -- unlikely to come directly from Latin pettia, likely instead Old French or Old Occitan.
a -- disputed. See Bonnet 356 for discussion. Earlier discussion : C̟abej 1976, Pederson 1900(ː322), Meyer, Demiraj 1997. 
abdikoj -- learned medieval Latin loan. 
abonsina -- medieval formation based on Latin and something else. 
abonsinëm -- see abonsina. 
abrogoj -- learned medieval Latin loan. 
abuzoj -- learned medieval Latin loan. 
adhuroj -- learned Latin loan -- Orel 1998 : 1. 
adresë -- borrowed from some descendant of Latin ad directus cf French adresse. The culprit may very well be French itself though. 
art -- medieval learned Latin loan. 
ashër, ashkë -- attributed by 19th century sources to Latin, but Proto-Albanian by Orel 2000. Miklosich attributes to Neapolitan. Reexamine
avokat -- likely from French, not Latin directly. 
avull -- later formation based on Latin vallum, but not directly desccended. 
avulli -- see above. 
bagëm -- per Topalli 2017, contaminated by bekoj. 
bagolinë -- via Venetian. 
bari -- dicey and very uncertain. Occasionally attributed to barōnem.
bekim -- later ccoinage with Latin base. 
beronjë -- "barren woman; holly; kind of serpent" Orel argues the Alb is from PAlb̽ *bara itself from Gmc *baraz (contact where?) Bugge attributes to Old French baraigne "barren"
bërsi -- Romance brūtea, Latin brīsa, Brüch ssays "illyrian" others Thracian, Demiraj Thracian, Çabej native. Per Marr 2023, Angevin rule  loan from langue d'oil
bëruo -- from Lat. barō, but did not survive into modern Albanian (in Buzuku) -- Bonnet 1998: 367. 
bibliotekë -- learned loan from Latin... or Romance (...French, Italian) -- more modern? 
binjak -- later coinage with Latin base. 
bis -- although attributed to a Latin bis, likely a loan from Romance -- Dashi 2017(:97) lists it as from Italian. 
bulë -- "soft flesh" (not "bud") -- medieval learned Latin loan. (TODO citaiton?) 
brumës -- likely actually just brumë + the suffix ës, not brumarius as is claimed. 
brushtull -- via Venetian.
çun -- via Venetian (maybe -- or maybe native). Or from Italian cionno "penis", one particular proposal states. 
debil  -- learned medieval Latin loan. May be French? 
dëboj -- variants zboj, xboj, cboj. From boj, dho some connect to disbinare. 
dëfrej -- later morphological invention. 
delfin -- learned Latin loan. 
dhespër -- attributed to Latin vesper, but even disregarding the v, the s would have been sh had it been the right period.
dhisk -- attributed to Latin discus, but more likely a later Greek loan (i.e. diskos), judging from the fact that we have s not sh /ʃ/ and /ð/ 
dishull -- Orel attributes it to a Latin disculus but few agree.
dot -- attributed to Latin by some (Mihăescu, Meyer) but is likely just lexicalized sequence of do + të. 
dua -- attributed to Latin by some but almost certainly native. 
drejtoj -- derived from drejt. Bonnet 2003(:255).
egjër -- from Latin ebria, but contaminated by egër "drunk" -- Orel 2000 p26. He later acts like it is regular however on p111... reexamine. 
familje -- one of the (many) medieval Albanian learned loans from Latin. 
fajkë -- likely via Dalmatian. Orel 1998: 92. 
fabrikë -- learned medieval Latin loan. Doublet of farkë.
fallco -- "fake". Occasionally attributed to Latin, but probably Italian falso. Perhaps listed as falso in Dashi 2013 (:200). Other 
Western Romance sources may be possible: Venetian? 
fashë -- singularized plural of fashqë... or maybe a loan from Aromanian (cf Romanian fașă)
fëlligë -- from Venetian fadiga -- Orel 1998ː95. 
fëlqinjë -- secondary Albanian suffixation of falx (accusative falcem) with -injë (< īnea) -- see Bonnet 1998: 338. 
fëng , fang -- "virgin land", from Italian fango. Orel 1998ː 96. May want to look at this one again (TODO). 
fënjeshtër -- Italian loan. Vatasescu 98. 
festë -- although widely attributed to "Latin", this is probably actually from Old French, Old Occitan, or some medieval Italian 
idiom. Otherwise we'd have *feshtë. At least there must be some Neo-Latin influence. 
fishnjar -- "harpoon, marten" < fushnje < fuscinia, but derived. 
fitore -- from victoria but "via some Balkan Romance language". 
flakë -- though attributed to some unknown Latin because of Romanian flacără and Italian fiaccola, perhaps facula, it is also very probable this is native Albanian and related to flak, fletë etc., with the Romanian instead derived from the Albanian. 
flojerë, flojere -- Demiraj 1997 holds this is a loan from Aromanian fluiară. From this comes Greek flogera. Orel 1998(:100) attributes it to Romanian fluier. 
flori -- Gheg florî. Mpl florinj. "Gold, golden coins". Medieval Latin loan < florīnus. Orel 1998ː 100.
flutur, fluturo, fluturoj -- these too have been attributed to some unnatested Latin by Orel 1998 and by Meyer-Lübke before him, but per Cabej and Demiraj rather convincingly it is likely a native Albanian word related to fletë, flugë et cetera. 
foshnjë -- < fosh <ftosh < fētōsus ... morphological contractions and whatever, contrived, controversial. See Orel 1998ː 102. 
fqerënj -- appears limited to Arberesh. 
frushkull -- either radical transformation of Lat fistula and/or etymology. Orel 1998: 103. 
frutë -- likely from Italian frutta rather than Latin fructum direfctly. Or a learned Latin loan in medieval times. 
fshikull -- blend of frushkull and fshikë. Orel 1998ː 103. 
furrëqi -- "debauchery", in Buzuku but did not survive to modern Albanian (Çabej 1960; Bonnet 1998: 78, 212, 337)
fuzë -- learned Latin loan, likely medieval. Alternativelyː medieval Italian/Sic./Nap.
gadishull -- old Alb. calque (using Latin material) of Latin peninsula. 
gazmend -- "cheer", attributed to Latin gaudimentum, but as Bonnet 1998(: 339-40) argues convincingly, more likely a later learned reformation based on gaz "laughter" (< Lat GAVDIVM). 
gjëmë -- i.e. lament. Likely a backformation off of gjamëtë from Latin gemitum. Gjamenë in Buzuku, cf Romanian geamăt. 
gjeni -- "genius". medieval learned Latin loan. Vatraints gjiri, gjini, gjeni . Vatasescu 1997 p105. 
gjerman --"German". Puzzingly listed as native (which would render *gjarmër, nevermind that there were no Germans in Albania). Obviously a later learned loan, and very probably a modern one, i.e. 19th century or later. 
Gjirokastër -- later loan. 
gulm -- from gulçoj (via gulçm).
gomë -- learnred latin loan.
gotë -- via Venetian per Topalli 2017ː 561. But could regularly be from Latin gotta... 
grëmëratë -- Orel isn't sure oif its from a V Latin *cremora:tum or Latin glomera:tum with liquid assimilation. He argues Greek gramena'ta comes from this, but hwat if it's the reverse...? 
greshtë -- via Venetian gres[=ʃ]ta (< Lat agrestem) per Bonnet p15. 
gushë -- throat. Borowed from Romanian. Orel 1998: 128.
hulumtoj -- Orel 1998ː 151... "'to follow up, to track out, to investigate'. A parallel form hulmëtoj is phonetically closer to the source which is Rom *inventăre based on Lat invenīre 'to find out'. The complicated phonetic history of this word includes the assimilation of -v- to the pre-
ceding -n- and then the dissimilation of two nasals and the loss of the second one. Finally, a prothetic h- was added. The irregularities may reflect an unusual way of the word acquisition (via hunters' slang?).
hutë -- vulture, owl. Variously attributed to Laitn or Middle Greek. Or it could be onomatatpoeia cf "hoot". 
irënoj -- some sort of later loan. 
javë -- may be native, or from hebdomas, but that is problematic diachronic phonologically 
jehonë, jehoj -- from jeh. 
Jozë, Jozef, Josef, Jozif, Zef, etc. -- must be later laons from Latin. 
kaçavidë -- via Venetian, per Topalli 2017ː 683. 
kajnacë -- via Venetian -- Topalli 2017ː 691. 
kaloj -- attributed to coallāre by Orel 1998(ː167). But allāre existed only in Gallo-Romance. Better explanation is from Proto-IE *keleu cf Lithuanian keliáuju "journey", A Greek kélevthos "way". 
kamare -- via Greek.
kanavacë -- via Venetian -- Topalli 2017ː 708.
kanavetë -- via Venetian -- Topalli 2017ː 708.
kandar -- via Greek and Turkish. 
kanushë -- < Latin cānōsus. Orel 2000(ː33) has it as regular, but it may be from Dalmatian kanausa, and in either case it seems to be a Gheg loan into Tosk hence why it's not kërushë. 
kapërcej -- attributed to Latin by Meyer but this isn't very likely, instead likely ka - për - ecëj .Orel 1998ː 169.
kaptoj -- attributed to Latin but it's actually from kapërtoj. Orel 1998ː 170.
kapuç -- 'hood', from Italian cappuccio -- Topalli 2017ː 719.
kargatis -- via Venetian -- Topalli 2017ː 724. 
karrige -- via Venetian 
kasolle, kësollë -- via Greek per Mihaescu 1993 p456 apud Vatasascu 1997 p97. 
këlshêjt -- communion cup, chalice < calicem sanctum. Likely formed as compound in Albanian rather than Lat -- see Çabej St. I 272. Orel 1998ː 176. 
këmbë -- "leg, foot". this one is dicey. Variously considered native, from Anc Greek kampé, from Latin gamba or from some local Latin camba that is unattested except for Catalan cama. 
këpushë -- borrowed from Romanian căpușă. Orle 1998: 179.
kërthi, kërthinjë etc -- argued to come from a *CHORDINUS by Candrea 1927 (apud Vatasescu 1997: 17) but this etymon isn't listed in the REW and there's a rival native etymology
kësulë -- via Greek
koqe -- derivative of kokë. Orel 1998ː 190-191.Orel 1998ː 203. 
korbull -- later formation of Latin corbis + ull. Not the korbull from Latin corbula though. 
kosh -- hypothetical (per Orel) reflex of Latin cāseus, from which rëkosh comes via a prefixal derivative. But this is kind of contrived, may not merit inclusion. 
kreatyrë -- learned Latin loan. Bonnet 1998: 88.
kullumbri -- from an unattested *kullumbë < Lat columba. 
kulshedër, kuçedër -- Albanian mythological equivalent of hydra. Attributed by Mihăescu, Orel etc to Lat chersydrus. Camarda argues it is native in coinage: kulish / kuç + hydra. Latin case is weak at best here I think. Also attributed to Latin chersydrus by Bonnet 377 though... re-add? 
kur -- probably not actually from Latin quā hōrā  (>*kerrë?) 
kusht -- backformation of kushtoj < kostare.
kuti -- derivation off of kut
kuzhinë -- via Venetian. Gheg: guzhinë.
lab -- < S Slavic labanʲja < olbanʲja < Albania. 
lalë -- a Lallwort (haha). 
laps -- "pencil", seems to be from Italian lapis per Dashi 2013 -- despite being listed as Latin for example by wiktionary. 
lavdi -- derived from lavdë
lavdëroj -- derived from lëvdoj and lavd. 
lenoj -- borrowed from Italian. Orel 1998ː 218.
lëpjetë -- likely just shares the source of Latin lapathum, not being derived from it .See Cabej 1976. Via Greek -- Orel 199̈8ː 225. 
lexoj -- via Venetian.
lorzë -- some sort of diminutive of Lorinae (Latin). 
lubi -- attributed to luvgat < lupus peccatus by Orel, but semantically dubious. More likely from PAlb *laubitja. Slavic lugat, lubiti may be also relevant. 
makinë -- learned latin loan, from machina. 
maraj -- via Byzantine Greek. But some attribute it straight to Latin -- cf Orel 2000(ː110) for an attempt at Albanian-from-Latin explanation. 
mashurkë -- from mashë.
mbërrij -- ambi + arrij. 
mblatë -- from blatë.
mbuloj -- "to seal", from bulë. 
mbutoj -- "to seal, to bung", from but. 
meshoj -- "to weigh" -- I propose this is the Gheg specific outcome of in-pensare (cf. peshoj). 
mëlçi -- via Italian milza. Orel 1998ː 359.
mërgjyzë -- Mëri + gjizë i.e. "mary's breast". Per Orel 1998(:262). Or: from something to do with narcissus (the flower)? 
meshnohem -- "to become ssenile, childish, to dote". From mbë (>me) ̟ senēre (>shëmoj) "to be old". NOt regular as it's derived.
metodë -- learned Latin loan. 
milor -- borrowed from Aromanian per Topalli 2017. 
mishkonjë -- < mushkonjë < feminine derivative of mushkë < Lat musca "fly"
model -- via Old Itallian modello. 
mollë -- attributed to Latin mālum by Orel 2000(ː31), but he acknowledges it must have entered Alb, unlike all other Latin words with ā, before the labialization of ā > o. Schumacher and Matzinger 2013(ː221) give a better explanation -- From Doric Greek māla, which also explains the gender.
moment -- doublet of mend, a more recent learned loan. 
mur -- Italian laoan? Cabej 1962: 164, etc. Or not? See discussion in Vatasescu 1997 p99.
mushllinzë ---"mushllinza 'clambering vetch'. A parallel (secondary) form is bushllizë. Based on *mushllî borrowed from Rom *mustēlīna. The latter is a derivative of Lat mustēla 'weasel'. For the semantic development cf. Russ myšijgorošek 'mouse vetch'. Ö ÇABEJSr. I 360 (from *mbështëllizë, to mbe'shtjell)." -- from Orel 1998(ː280) but this all seems rather contrived... ː(. 
ndorë -- a backformation.
nëng ~ nang -- "nont, adverb. unclear. Meyerː Lat numquam? Huld ː ne nuk ? Orel is unsure (1998ː 291. 
ngordh -- "to die (of animals)". Attributed by some to inchordare as in it. sp., Rom. încorda; but could be native (Cabej 1982: 102). See Vatasescu 1997: 74.  
ngjalë -- attributed to Latin anguilla but likely PRoto-Albanian engella regularly from PIE, cf also Illyrian tribe enchele. 
njerk -- backformation from njerkë
ofendoj -- later learned Latin loan. 
ofroj -- attributed to Latin offerre (1sg offero:) sometimes, but likely from Italian -- Dashi 2017: 304. 
orë -- later learned medieval Latin loan. Doublet loaned in antiquity: herë
pagë -- "pay, wages". loaned from Italian paga? Dashi 2013: 313. 
pagëzoj -- from Latin baptizāre, but effected by either dissimilation (Orel 1998) or contamination from bagëm "anointing oil" (Topalli 2017). Listed as reegular(?) by De Vaan 2017: 1744. 
paguaj -- listed as from Latin pa:ca:re on Wiktionary, but by scholarly research (Dashi 2013: 313) as from Italian(?). Absent from Orel 1998 and Bonnet 1998. 
palë -- attributed to Latin PAR by Bonnet 384 but never justified; asserted as native by others. Romanian pală is likely cognate but htat doesn't mean necessarily that it comes from Latin PAR.
Palush -- later coinage, likely with the diminutive --ush.
pall, përrall -- verb, to jest. Derived from përrallë "tale, story". Orel 2000ː 112. 
p ˌɑ n t ˈɑː r i u m , p a n d ˈɛ ɾ ə $apron, embroidered sash. Based on pantex "pouch". Or from Romance *panticārium cf Romanian pântecaraie? Orel 1998: 310. However Bonnet (1998:333) and Cabej 1960 -- this dialectal Calabrian Arbereshe word actually comes from a local form Italian bandiera, bandera, not pant(ic)arivs as Meyer 1891 thought. 
panjë -- from Latin plātinus > paltën, with resuffixation followed by radical contraction. 
parajs -- likely from Venetian. See Bonnet 1998(:15-17) and Marr 2023(:11). 
parajsë -- likely from Venetian or Greek. See Bonnet 1998(:15-17) and Marr 2023(:11). 
paradhis -- likely via Greek. See Marr 2023(:11).  
pendohem -- later resuffixation. Originally from Latin poeniteō
pengesë -- attributed to some "form" of Latin pedica. This seems very hand-wavey; should check what Topalli says. 
perëndi -- disputed, but either a derivation off of perëndoj < parentare, or a native formulation. 
përvist -- unknown etymology. Seems to be only in Arberesh... some Italo-Romance idiom? 
peshore -- later coinage. 
pezulloj -- later derivation off of pezull. 
pilë -- from Italian pila.
pincar -- Sicilian loan. 
pisë -- onomatapoeia and/or Romanian pisă. Orel 1998: 327.
pishkulloj -- irregular outcome of Romance fistulare with f > p . 
plëndës -- via Venetian. 
pleq -- "council". Sometimes attributed to Lat *placius < placitus "order"< but most likely we're just dealing with pleq, the plural of plak "old man">
pranverë -- prëndverë, prandverë dialectally. "Phonetic calque" of Latin prīmavēra. Attributed to regular development from Latin by Orel 2000ː 31, 54. May need to reexamine.
projë -- deverbal from proj -- as is <prime>.
provë -- from Italian prova. Dashi 2017: 355. 
p r ˌo b ˈɑː r e , p r ɔ v ˈɔ j $verb: to try, test/prove/verify. the VbV -VvV is surprising here and suggests Western Romance -- cf 
Venetian provar, Old French prouver, Occitan provar; all of these may be possible "Norman/Angevin/Venetian" medieval sources. Consider 
also this may have been in the Vulgar Latin that entered Albanian -- see Italian provare and Sicilian pruvari. Dashi 2017(:355) lists 
this as from Italian provare.
psalënj -- Arbëresh only (verbː to publish, render official). Attributed to psalmus, looks like a medieval learned coinage, not an anccient one. Re-examine. 
pulegër -- Italian or Dalmation. 
pupël -- via Venetian. 
qafë -- Romanian ceafă isfrom Alb here, both from Turkish kafa. 
qeros, qeroz -- scabby. Attributed to carriosus by Vatasescu 1997 p72, but shouldn't that give -sh? More l
qiftër -- via Byzantine Greek. (?? relation to skifter tho?) 
qudohem -- via Italian chiudere "to shut". 
r ˈɑː p u m , r a p $turnip, beet. Modern form is rrepë, from the plural, but rrap attested in the Albanian of recent centuries. Attributed by some instead to Greek rhápus, PSlav *rěpa or natively from PAlb *(s)rˈāps. Orel 1998(;381) etc. 
rajon -- allegedly from Latin regionem, but not listed in Orel 1998 or in Bonnet 2003... likely instead is a loan from Russian rajon? Of course Old French royon, which wouold be rayon in the West,  is possible. 
rast, rasë -- Turkish. 
rëkosh -- "fat cheese", prefixed kosh from Lat cāseus. Kosh unattested tho.
rem -- "copper", singularized plural of attested former sing ram, itself from Italian rame. 
r u ˌiː n ˈɑː r e , r ə n ˈɔ j $verb: to demolish. A Gheg loan into Tosk -- Orel 1998: 384. 
resë -- calque of lat but not a borrowing. 
resht -- via rreshtoj. 
rig -- via Greek. Rigash derived thereof.
rigë -- derivative from rigoj.
rokominë -- "shrunk old man", from Italian.
rrâni -- seems to only be in Gheg. 
rrëfanë -- uncertain. Native with second component PAlb *span(d)ā unattested, or from Latin REFERRE. Per Orel, from rrëfej. 
rrëfoj -- uncertain origin, cf rrëfanë. 
rrej ~ rrêj -- aor ẽrrejta -- Demiraj attributes to Lat errōneus, but Orel (1998ː 380) has it from PAlb *arn-enja. 
rrënim, rrënojë -- derived from rrënoj
rrojbë -- from Romanian roibă < Lat rubia. 
rrotulloj -- from rrotull.
rrugë -- via Venetian ruga. 
sekondë -- modern Latin loan, or maybe from Italian secondo or French seconde. 
serrë -- via Italian.
sfejkë -- "beet". Orel 1998(ː395) argues from Lat felicem, filicem . Very dubious to say this comes direct from Latin but in any case we have a morphological innovation in the prefixing of s-. 
sfurk -- prefixal form of furkë < Lat furca. Same as above, a lexicalized morphological innovation. 
s ˌi n k ˈeː r u s , s i n c ˈɛ ɾ t ə $honest. Final -të likely inserted by analogy as it is an adjective. However this one is suspicious 
and looks like a likely medieval Latin loan. TODO cite a scholarly source -- it's online but not in Bonnet 1998 nor Orel 1998; reexamine. 
Dashi 2017(: 397) identifies it as an Italian loan into Old Albanian (used in Buzuku it seems). 
sipër -- Latin sometimes invoked (super -- Pedersen, Miklosich, Camarda, Gil'ferding), but likely from përsipër, së epër ablative of i epër etc see Cabej, Orel 1998̈(ː396). 
sfytyrij -- "to snort". Like sfejkë, sfurk, a lexicalized morphological innovation in sf-. 
sikundër -- variant of sindëkur, compound of si ̟ ndë, kur. Camarda has it from sefcundum as does Meyer nonetheless...
shaj -- Meyer has it from Latin *sannari from sanna "grimace" bugt likely instead a prefixal form of Alb ënj "to blow out, be indignant".
shemër -- origin very uncertain. Orel 1998: 411 etc.
shikoj -- attributed to sequor by Orel, but Chabej presents a convincing countercase. 
shiloj -- from shalë. 
shitë -- from shitoj. 
shkalis -- derivation off of kalë. 
shkallaq -- from shkalloj.
shkëlqej, shkëlqar -- derivation off of qelq? 
shkoq -- from kokë. 
shkrumb -- Romanian scrum is from Albanian, not the reverse -- Orel 1998ː 423-4. 
shkulkë -- Albanian to Romance, not reverse. Orel 1998ː 424. 
shkupë -- warm spring wind. Derived from Shkup i.e. Skopje. 
shkurrë -- "bush". May be attributed to Lat cornea -- cf Meyer. Also attributed to Slavic (Jokl), or Celtic (Baric, Schuhardt). Unclear. Reexamine. May be native after all. 
shllim -- from shlloj, variant shembelloj. "idea".  
shpagë -- from pagë.
shpalcë, shparzë -- unclear, disputed. Orel 1998ː 426. 
shpall -- disputed. Orel 1998ː 426. Likely from përrallë tho. 
shpëloj -- ("to rinse") -- likely from laj ("to wish") but may be from Romanian spăla ~ Aromanian aspel < Late Latin perlavare, or from the same source somehow. Native etymololy seems most likely here though. Variants incclude shplaj and shpërlaj.
shpoj -- attributed to Latin either expugere, expungere "to prick, strike out" (Meyer) or expaagere "to pierece" (Camarda and Orel). but perhaps rather follow Jokl and Demiraj in a plausible internal explanation from PAlb *pēri < PIE *per. 
shpor -- attributed to either Gothic, Gothic via Latin *spora, or PIE *per "to lead across, bear, penetrate" -- Orel 1998: 430.
shpresoj -- likely a derivation off of shpresë, all though there are some who claim in comes from Latin spērāre in some way.
shqeme -- from medieval Latin. Orel 1998ː 331. 
shqepoj -- from shqep.
shqipe -- "Albanian". From shqipoj. On historical and cultural importance of this calque of *slovene being "unprecedented", see Orel 1998: 434. "This situation must have followed the Proto-Albanian period".
shregull -- from rregull. 
shtëpi -- "house", variant shpi. Supposedly from Latin hospitium, but this has issues, and it may even be native, compare shpie "to bear, carry" 
shtërras -- unclear and disputed. May even be from shter, native. 
shtijë -- attributed to Lat. hastīle by Orel, but Lat hastīle < hasta itself is likely from P-Alb, cf Alb heshtë, ushtë... However, now readded on the basis of Bonnet 1999 and De Vaan 2017.
shtog -- "elder, elderberry". Attributed to Latin sabucus by some, i.e. Haarman, and Bonnet (p88, 109-110); Meyer 1891(: 417) attributes it to Romanian soc hesitantly, as this word is also hard to explain in Romanian. Çabej is uncomfortable with this (as am I), while Orël (1998: 440) prefers an Albanian internal etymology. 
shtrembëroj, shtrembaluq, shtrembëri -- from shtremb. 
shtrep -- borrowed to Romance, not from.
shtrungë -- borrowed to Romance (and Slavic), not from. 
shtupoj -- probably form shtupë
shuaj -- likely from shuj. Some people argue for this coming from Latin subjugare, but I think this is pretty imaginative, semantically and phonologically alike. 
shurdhër, shurdhët, shurdhuar, shurdhak, shurdhac-- likely derived from shurdh. Though maybe you could have surdinus > shurdhër. Note Gheg form shurdhën. This  is not necessary however. 
shurqel -- morphological innovation from Latin supercadere ultimately. Orel 1998: 446 .
skifter -- from accipiter. Contaminated by shqiponjë (kqifter > skifter). 
spec, speca etc. -- via Italian spezie. 
sqetull -- Orel 1998(:400) calls it a "late borrowing (with Lat s- rendered as s-) from Rom *scetula cf Lat scutula". Other opinion is that of Huld and Hamp where by it's ultimately from IE *kwekw-los", drawing attention to the variant sjetull as well. 
stinë, stinor -- source iunclear, some assert a "late irregular borrowing from Latin stationem" but in any case does not seem an inherited word from Latin into P-Alb. 
supozoj -- via (modern) French. 
taft -- attributed to Latin tāftus by Orel 2000(ː116) but much more convincingly të + aft "warmth of a fire" < PAlb *aweita < PAlb h2weh1- "blowing of wind" 
thark -- borrowed to Romanian țarc, not the reverse. 
thartë -- Romanian sarbăd from this, not to this. 
thumb, thumbull -- borrowed t oROmanian ciump, sâmbure, not hte revverse.
tentoj -- attributed to Italian tentare. But may instead be Old French tenter? `
terig -- via Venitian. 
tërsirë -- borrowed from Romanian. 
tetor, shtator, nëntor, dhjetor -- calques but not actual Latin loans. 
tojë -- via Venetian. 
tok -- possibly Latin but more likely onomatapoiea.
tokël -- via Italian. 
tork, torq "beam of the oil press; wine-press" -- from Italian torchio, whence *torq, becoming tork by analogy to the widespread palatalizing plural pattern (Orel 1998: 460). Meyer 1891(: 433) attributes directly to Latin torculum though. Doublet of torkull/trokull.    
toskë -- via Venetian. 
trath, trenoj -- from tra. 
tradhtoj, tradhtia -- from tradhëtar (?). Or from Italian, per Vatasescu 1997(:472). 
trajke, tratke etc -- via Dalmatian and/or Serbo-Croatian.
transferoj -- modern borrowing etc etc. 
tremb -- supposedly form tremulare per Puscariu 1905(:164), tentatively for Vatasescu 1997(:61). But even if it is, there is a change in inflection class. 
trinoj - from trinë. 
trishtoj, trishtuar -- from trishtë
truall -- attributed to Latin tribulum by Orel, but the semantics doesn't quite make sense. 
turpëroj -- from turp.
urinë -- medieval or modern Latin loan? Literature isn't sure but regular result would be something like (y)̈rrinë? 
utull -- "benefit, profit". Someone online suggests Latin utilis -- may need to check
vagëlloj -- complicated etymological derivation from Lat vagus. 
vaginë, vagjinë -- learned Latin loan. 
vargër -- "uncastrated ram". May be from Latin virgo/inem or Greek varichoi arnes... or unknown. 
vatër -- from an Iranian (Sarmatian?) *otar per Orel 2000(:37). Although sometimes attributed to Romance. 
veshtull -- From unattested *vesht, continuing *veshk < Lat viscum per Orel 1998̈(ː502). Too convoluted to include. 
vetlloj -- from vetull.
vrikë -- Italian dialectal vrica. Orel 1998ː 516. 
xixë -- "descriptive" or Italian.
