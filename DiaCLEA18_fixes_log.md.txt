Not counting "uninteresting" formatting related changes that were also done to fix the baselines. 

# A. Rule insertion

Rules that were inserted because of missed phenomena or to make other phenomena work. These are effectively proposals. 

## A1 Insertion of phenomena that are quite reminiscent of other phenomena in the baseline cascade. 

## A2 Insertion of phenomena that are something new under the sun from the perspective of the baseline. 

A2.I - l > ʎ / [+hi] __ [+hi],  inserted after the emergence of dark L 
	(which it counterbleeds, and which in DiaCLEA18 occurs much earlier because the posited intermediate long *l: stage is replaced by an immediate of its would-be reflex, dark l, /lˠ/). 

A2.II - j > ∅ disappearance of j after w in APA. Handles at least three etymaː laqueum > lak, quiētum > qet-ë, salviella > shërbelë (especially the latter; we do not see shërbgjelë or shërgjelë). Perhaps also alveolum > *lullë > nullë "gum", if we believe in that etymology. Inserted at rule 19, which currently is just before the deletion of /w/ in APA ... though this may change. 

# B Rule relocdation

Rules that were moved to different points in the cascade. 

## B1 -- rule moved to a later time

## B2 -- rule moved to an earlier time 

B2.I - DV1740E3, ln and ll > l, moved to before lambdacism (moved from rule instant 13 to 10), as it seems to feed it. 

B2.II - DV1740F3 -- the lengthening of intervocalic l (and sl > l: (...> lˠ)) before non-front vowels (which is now just straight to darkening, per D3.I) is moved to before DV1740E3 after it was moved forward, as DV1740E3 counterfeeds it. In order to do so, [-front] is now explicitly stipulated in the posterior context. 

## B3 -- possible relocdations to pre-Latin period out of deletions to test (TODO!) 

B3.I -- D1.I - DV1740G2: intervocalic lambdacism before front vowels 

B3.II -- D1.II -- DV1740F2: l coalescence with nearby resonant to dark L, see also B4.I

## B4 -- possible relocdations to later periods out of deletions to test (TODO!) 

B4.I -- D1.II -- DV1740F2: l coalescence with nearby resonant to dark L, see also B3.II 


# C Changes in conditioning to improve accuracy

Rule input, output, or context conditioning changed. These are done to improve accurcay 

## C1 -- changes in input 

### C1A -- input made broader

C1A.I -- prosthesis of w- before initial ō now broadened to also occur before initial short ǒ

### C1B -- input made narrower

C1B.I - Gliding rule (R9 in baseline): [-prim] --> [-stres], countertonic vowels are excempted from gliding at this time. 
C1B.II -- DV1740F3 -- now only applies to r l 
C1B.III -- DV2.2.2c -- first reduction (and then loss) of internal posttonic vowels now does not occur for low vowels... yet. 

## C2 -- changes in output 

## C3 -- changes in context conditioning 

### C3A -- context made broader

### C3B -- context made narrower

C3B.I -- "preconsonantal" ʃ to t͡ʃ in most recent modern Albanian is now only pre-nasal
	(this fix increased accuracy by a whole 1% alone)

C3B.II -- ai > ē blocked prevocalically. 

C3B.III -- i-mutation blocked by prior labial elements
		-- this change alone, not made finer, led to a 1.3% increase in accuracy, at an early stage
		and many of the words it did not fix, it set on the right track. 
			-- though further changes are needed to both the specification and the timing of i-mutation it seems... 

## C4 -- changes in both input and output

## C5 -- changes in both input and context conditioning

## C6 -- changes in both output and context conditioning

## C7 -- all three changed. 


# D Rule deletion and cascade simplification

Rules that were deleted, or rather suppressed technically (they were commented out) because there was not much to be gained by keeping them, and/or there was much to be lost. This will also include rule consolidation. 

##D1 -- rules deleted to improve accuracy

D1.I - DV1740G2: intervocalic lambdacism before front vowels
	  it behaved correctly in two cases, and erros in 28
	- of the one it behaved correctly in, it was unnecessary to get the result. 
	- and the remaining correct case, vjej "I need", could have been actually from some sort of *valiere or *valiare rather than the attested valēre for all we know. 

##D2 -- rules deleted as they were redundant

##D3 -- consolidation of multiple rules into single rule. 

D3.I - DV1740F3: original rule was Lat *l > l: / V __ V[-front], now just having this go straight to lˠ as the step of having /lː/ turns out unnecessary, and the conditioning suggests a dark L. This thus involves the effecive deletion of DV3.1E. 

D3.II -- Kortlandt's early final s-deletion is consolidated with the deletion of final nasals, s and -ns that was originally placed right before the earliest vowel drops that were right before the flag for Middle Proto-Albanian. These are currently placed early in the period, where Kortlandt's shift had been placed. 

# E larger changes in progress, with things to consider... 

-- prior labial consonants blocking i-mutation. (TODO!! important)

-- moving the intervocalic stop drops to somewhere, maybe early Middle Proto-Albanian
	and/or considering cluster simplification alternatives to simple intervocalic stop drops
		this is caught up in the question of when unstressed vowels were lost -- when did those clusters form.

also related to the above ^ -- when did vowel reduction occur relative to i-mutation, and relative to intervocalic stop drops, which has major implications for the timing of i-mutation relative ot intervocalic stop drops
	... and the role of prior labials in potentially blocking i-mutation..

...come back to thisǃ 

working on file showing similarities between APA /b/ and /w/ developments... will come up with decisions and implement soon... 
	(for now fixing more basic things first ) 


there is also some sort of (pretonic?) beta and delta triggered cluster voicing phenomenon that appears to be missed this far, part of other general cluster simplifications that seem to be missed thus far...
