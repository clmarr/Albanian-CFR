At present, periods are intended to be held constant for different cascades.

Existing treatments such as that of Demiraj, De Vaan, and Orel, have both similarities and differences in their periodization. 
One major commonality is that they all define Proto-Albanian in reference to the timing of loan words, and that Latin loans are the most important, especially the initial main wave of Latinisms.
Secondary importance is applied to Slavic waves, medieval Romance waves, and the various Greek waves; modern Turkish/Romance/etc waves are all assigned to Old or Early Modern Albanian. 
Orel 2000(:xii) has "Early" Proto-Albanian (EPA) and Late Proto-Albanian (LPA). 
OErel's PA is placed decisively just before the first main Latin influx, which Orel assumes is the 1st century CE (others date this earlier, a century or two back).
Its relationship to Greek loans is not clear other than usually describing them as following the same patterns as the native vocabulary. 
Orel's LPA is dated to hte 6th or 7th CE "following the contacts with Proto-Romance and ancient Slavic dialects still close to Proto-Slavic". 
This leaves Old Albanian to describe the Albanian of medieval times, with variants Old Tosk, Old Gheg). 
Demiraj 2006 dates the end of Proto-Albanian or effectively a "Late Proto-Albanian" stage a century earlier but still adheres to the framework of ending Proto-Albanian where Slavic loans begin. 
De Vaan 2018 adheres to Demiraj's periods, while noting that there are just a few early Slavic loans that do show n-rhotacism -- so these can be placed just before the end of Proto-Albanian.
De Vaan does not have Early and Late Proto-Albainan, but rather Pre-Proto-Albanian (PPAlb) and Proto-Albanian PAlb); he toys also with breaking these two periods, 
internally breaking PPAlb on teh basis of when Greek loans occurred, and breaking PAlb on the timing of contact with Proto-Romanian. 
Another view does have "Late Proto-Albanian" continuing long after teh dialect split happened, until the onset of Turkish laons -- which for most other accounts is effectively Early Old Albanian (Gheg, Tosk...). 
Some accounts, especially Orel's, also distinguish different waves of Latin loans (and different waves of Slavic loans).
At least three Latin waves not attributed to specific later Romance languages appear to be there.

The goal here is to make a periodization that is consistent and can fit different views. 
There are to be no gold stages before attested Old Albanian in the 15th/16th/17th centuries.
The main purpose of different stages is to have consistent times to compare, and times to place the entry of different items into the lexicon operated upon. 
Thus the following policies apply.

Proto-Albanian refers to stages that are before the split of Gheg and Tosk. 
After Proto-Albanian, Gheg and Tosk get separate treatment. 
The few rhotacised Slavic words in Tosk can be placed before this (if there is not another explanation). 

Since all Proto-Albanian changes common to Gheg and Tosk happen before then, the stage LATE PROTO-ALBANIAN refer to the accumulation of all of these changes before the split. 

Thus, the stages: 

1. Proto-Indo-European
2. Early Pre-Proto-Albanian -- EPPA -- before earliest Greek loans.
3. Later Pre-Proto-Albanian -- LPPA -- circa 150 BCE, after earliest Greek loans, before earliest Latin loans (and next wave of Greek loans per Huld 1986?)
