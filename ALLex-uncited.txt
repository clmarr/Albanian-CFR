ˌɑ l ˈe k s i u m , lˠ ˈɛ ʃ $Llesh, i.e. Alex. Variant form: Lesh. TODO cite; TODO would be later loan.
ˌɑ n d r ˈo n i k u s , n d ɾ ˈɛ k $Andrew. Variant: Ndre (isn't that Andrew though?). TODO cite a scholarly source; does not seem to be in Bonnet 1998. TODO Ndroq?
b ˌe n e d ˈi k t u m , b d ˈɛ k $a given name, cf. to Benoit, Bennet etc. On Wiktionary. TODO cite or propose, not in Bonnet 1998. 
d ˌɑ n i ˈeː l e m , d a ɲ ˈɛ lˠ $Daniel. Likely actually a slightly later loan? TODO cite a scholarly source or propose; does not seem to be in Bonnet. 
ɡ ˌɑ r r i ˈɑː r e , ɟ ɾ ˈɔ j $verb: to chat. Considered "unknown" by some. TODO cite. Gjëroj? Not in Bonnet 1998 nor Orel 1998, where there is a different explanation for gjëroj (p349) which is a different word ("to swear") anyways. 
l ˈɑ w d ɑ m , l ˈa v d ə $eulogy. TODO cite or propose. Not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998 it seems. Later formation? Would be into MPA III (TODO)
l ˌɑ w d ˈɑː t ɑ m , l ə v d ˈa t ə $eulogy. TODO cite or propose. Not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998 it seems. Reexamine, may be Alb formation (-atë ? ) . Into MPA III (TODO)
m ˌɑ r ˈiː k ɑ m , m ɾ i k ə $Mary. Variant: Mëri from maria. Not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998. TODO cite, would be later loan. 
p ˌɑ r t ˈiː t ɑ , p a r t ˈi $(political, legal) party. Attributed to Latin online (TODO cite scholarly source -- not in Bonnet 1998, nor Orel 1998), yet Old French parti and or partie (in the sense of "part" and "party (law)") seems very likely responsible, given the loss of t in VtV and the semantics... sometimes attributed to medieval Latin, but this doesn't explain the loss of -t- (cf. Marr 2023). TODO cite, reexamine. 
p ˈe n d e u l u s , p ˈɛ z u lˠ $suspended, abolished. Normal Latin would be pendulus that appears phonologically to be tied to pendo, pendere, but it's plausible we are dealing with an analogized form based on pendeo, pendēre (which was originally, opaquely, the actual source of pendulusǃ). TODO cite scholarly source, reexamine, remove or propose; is there is nasalism in Gheg? Not in Bonnet 1998 nor Orel 1998... 
p r ˌiː s t ˈiː n ɑ , p ɾ i ʃ t ˈi n ə $Prishtina. May be problematic, re-examine. TODO cite, reexamine; remove or propose. 
r ˌɑː d ˈiː k eː s , ɾ a ð ˈi c e $bitter root, chicory, succory (Newmark 1998: 725).  From the plural of Latin radix. This (or accusative sg rādīcem?) is also the source in some Romance languagesː Italian radice, Mozarabic radici, (OHG rātih), Dalmatian radaica, Ligurian reixa, Sicilian radica, Venetian raixa. TODO cite something scholarly; not in Orel 1998 or Bonnet 1998. TODO into later layer.
r ˌe ɡ i ˈoː n e m , ɾ a j ˈɔ n $region. This looks suspicious. Why /j/ not /ɟ/? Why /̟e/ > /a/? May be from a Romance language: Old French royon. Venetian rejon? Angevin rayon cf. Marr 2023? TODO: cite something scholarly reexamine; not in Bonnet 1998 or Orel 1998. Could it even be something like a Russian loan? 
t ˈe m p l u m , t ˈɛ m p u lˠ $chapel, temple. PROPOSAL -- though also found online on wikt; not in Bonnet 1998's index, nor in Orel 1998...? Vatasescu, citing Haarmann 1977(Ș317), Kristophson 1988(:87) describes it as a Romance loan.
t r ˌɑː d i t ˈoː r e m , t ɾ a ð ə t ˈa ɾ $traitor. Variant: tradhtar. TODO cite, reexamine, remove or propose. Not in Orel 1998, also not in Bonnet 1998. Can be found online but is it in any scholarly sources? Vatasescu 1997(:472) doesn't mention tradhetar, but has tradhetoj as a loan from Italian (dh?) 
t r ˌi f ˈo l i u m , t ə ɾ f ˈi l $clover. For definition, but not etymology -- Newmark 1998: 865. Bonnet 1998(: 78, 126) discusses tërfojë (< TRIFOLIVM) but not this. Also not in Orel 1998. This definition is online but is it in any scholarly sources? TODO if not, propose. TODO currently included.
