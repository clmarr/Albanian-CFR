This Latin etymon is among the cases where Latin etyma survive in Albanian but not in Romanian (Vatasescu 1997: 496).  Root verb not attested. TODO to Christian vocab?

k r ˌe ˈɑː n t i ɑ , k ɾ i j ˈɛ s ə $creation. This is a proposed alternative etymology for krijesë (see below). Cf Spanish crianza, Portuguese criança, Italian creanza.  TODO Christian vocab?
k r ˌe ˈɑː t i oː , k ɾ i j ˈɛ s ə $creation. Cabej 1962 & Xhuvani apud Vatasescu 1997: 305. However see my alternative proposal above.  TODO Christian vocab?

Cf Romanian căciulă. Given stress pattern and that we have /l/ not /lˠ/, perhaps was actually from casúllam?.  Albanian kaçule > Romanian căciulă > Alb k̈ësulë per Orel 1998(:184).  TODO suspicious, may also be loan from Aromanian.


SORT






$unlikely but to be considered. NOT CURRENTLY TREATED AS SUCH. 

b ˌe n e d iː k ˈo n i oː , b ə n k ˈɔ j $verb. To bless.  Orel 2000: 116. Orel 1998: 20 -- more conservative variant in bënkoj, but more common form in bekoj. benedīcere as root per Orel 2000 and 1998. Listed as "benedicāre" deriving a bēkoj (as bēkon) in De Vaan 1734, but as -īcere elsewhere -- De Vaan's derivation looks more convincing though, perhaps reexamine. Stated  as "irrégulière" in Bonnet 1999ː 354. Topalli 2017: 190-191. "bënkoj" considered to be regular, with bekoj arising from influence from "be" oath. Bonnet 1999(ː354) suspects influence also from mallkoj ("to curse"), arguing -ng- was expected second syllable onset, with the bene-male distinction beting familiar due to knowledge of Italian or medieval Latin historically. Already bekuem in Old Gheg (Buzuku) -- Vatasescu 1997: 478. TODO possibly Christian vocab -- or not?
d ˈa e̯ m o n e m , d j ˈɛ m ə ɾ $djemër does not actually occur; this word is only reflected as djemën among specifically Gheg Catholics. Orel 1998: 68. TODO possibly Christian vocab but this may not be necessary, could just be Christianized
d ˌɑ m n ˈɑː n i oː , d ə n ˈɔ j $verb: to punish. Old Gheg, in Budi: dëmënim (for the verbal noun). Vatasescu 1997: 421. =Romanian a dăuna? TODO possibly Christian vocab but this may not be necessary, could just be Christianized
d ˈɑ m n u m , d ˈə m $harm, detriment (noun). Orel 2000: 105. Gheg: dam (dām). Bonnet 378. De Vaan 2017: 1736 as dām meaning "damage". Vatasescu 421 ~ Gheg dâm. Romanian daună. TODO possibly Christian vocab but this may not be necessary, could just be Christianized
ˌe k s p ˌe d iː t ˈɑː n i oː , ʃ p ə t ˈɔ j $verb: to save. Orel 1998: 429. Could be construed as Christian vocab but this may not be necessary. 
f ˈi d e m , f ˈɛ $religion. Attributed to fide:s by some but fidem by Orel 2000(:29). Orel 2000(:28-9) attributes it to "later layer of Latin loanwords" when short e reappeared. However, the loss of /d/ may be suspicious and suggest a later Romance loan. Candidates include: Old French fei ~ fai ~ foi, Old Occitan fe ~ fei, Venetian fè. Not candidatesː Sicilian fidi, Italian fede. Perhaps via Angevin (cf. Marr 2023). In theory could be construed as Christian vocab. 

ˈeː r e m u m , j ˈɛ ɾ m $wilderness. May instead be from Greek, around the same time with an analogous form. the related jeremí "hermit" is difficult. Vatasescu 1997: 455. Currently not treated as Christian vocab.
f ˈɑ l l i u m , f ˈa j $guilt, sin. From Lat fallere "to decieve, trick". Cf fallible. Orel 2000: 109. Orel 1998(:92) as fall. But fit into existing pattern with "fal" 'forgive', could be native? Bonnet 379 as fallium -- going with this for phonological and morphological reasons (it is masculine in the singular; faje, feminine, in plural -- phonologically this could be the reflex of a plural fallia? Cf socio > shoqe etc.) -- even though fallia seems to underlie Italian faglia, French faille etc (Bonnet 1998: 350). Landi 1989: 126; Çabej 1986 (I: 172); Haarmann 1972: 125; Meyer 1891: 98; Mihaescu 1993: 22. TODO Christian vocab MPA I, or could be just Christianized?
f ˌiː l i ˈɑː n u m , f ˈi j ə $godchild. Matasovic 2024: 63. Orel 1998: 96. Gheg only -- as fijan. Tosk *fijar or fijë doesn't actually exist. Bonnet 379 as (Gheg?) filan < fīliānus. Assume fijë based on Nboreanus > Tosk mˈurrë (vs. Gheg murrˈâ). Could be construed as Christian vocab.
f ˌi l i ˈɑ s t e r , θ j ˈɛ ʃ t ə ɾ $stepson. Remains fjeshtër in Arbereshë, but it is now thjeshtër in mainland Albanian. Bonnet 1998: 226, 343, 379. De Vaan 2017: 1742 as thjeshtër. Bonnet 1998(: 226) -- conservation of fj- limited to Piana dei Greci. Matasovic 2024: 64.Could be construed as Christian vocab.
ˌiː n f ˈe r n u m , f ˈɛ r $ hell, 'heck'. Orel 1998: 95. Bonnet 380.  De Vaan 2017: 1739. Could be construed as Christian vocab though this may not be necessary. 
ˌi n i ˌeː i uː n ˈɑː n i oː , ɲ ɟ ə ɾ ˈɔ j $verb: to fast. OGheg ëngjënoj. Matasovic 2024: 64. TODO possible Christian vocab?

k ˌoː n s ˈi l i u m , k ə ʃ ˈi lˠ $council(s). Orel 2000: 28, 37 -- a "later" case where on > ë. Bonnet 377. De Vaan 2017: 1735. Instead from consilum for Cabej 1967 t1(:87) apud vatasescu, while Desnickaja 1987 (: 236) argues the feminine form keshillë is from a plural in CONSILIA. TODO early Christian vocab?
l ˌɑ w k ˈɑː r u m , l i f c ˈa ɾ $waterfall (= ujvara?). From metathesis of Latin lavācrum per Orel 2000(:35), with intermediate ë > i in the first syll. May need to reexamine (is this a legit word?)-- TODO. Variant lifqer according to Orel 2000(ː35). Orel 1998: 227. Perhaps actually from a lav(a)cārium?  TODO Christian vocab?

m ˌɑ l e d iː k ˈo n i oː , m a lˠ k ˈɔ j $verb: to curse, damn. Orel 1998: 244. Bonnet 381. De Vaan 2017: 173 as mallëko(j). Lat inf maledīcěre.  TODO Christian vocab possibly by semantics but not clearly necessarily diachronic phonology-wise. Could be Christianized.

m ˌi s e r ˈɑː r iː , m ə ʃ ə ɾ ˈi e̯ ɾ $mercy, pity. Attested in Old Gheg, Buzuku and Bardhi -- Cabej 1964ː 25. Feminines in -ë also attested, as is mishërier. These forms are attributed to actualy coming from infinitives of the above -- Jokl 1916(: 146), Vatasescu 1997(: 432). TODO early Christian layer?
m ˌi s ˈe r i ɑ , m ə ʃ ˈi ɾ ə $mercy, pity. Orel 2000(:27) argues it, is a "later Latin" loan. TODO early Christian layer?
ˈo p e r ɑ , v ˈɛ p ə ɾ $deed, work (art). May be from (native) epër instead. But Orel 2000: 36 -- pre LPA. Orel 1998(ː499) attributes to unattested vapër ~ vopër, with vepër being a singularized plural. However, per Vatasescu 1997(ː327), Old Albanian has vepër too, so we're using this. TODO Christian vocab?
ˌo p e r ˈɑː n i oː , v ɛ p ɾ ˈɔ j $to put into action, do, work, take effect. Per Vatasescu 1997(:327), "nu este excluse derivarea de la vepër". TODO Christian vocab?

p ˌe k ˈu l i u m , p ɛ k ˈu l $personal wealth, precious friend; personal property to which an individual (and not family members) has right; property leased for high rent. Cabej 1962(: 180) apud Vatasescu. Phonological issues but semantically secure. Romanian dialectal picui, păcui; Aromanian picúl'iu, attributed as source of the Albanian by Puscariu, but this is less strong than Cabej's proposal. TODO Christian layer?
p ˌa e̯ n i t ˈeː n i oː , p ɛ n d ˈɔ j $verb: to regret, repent. As reflexive pendohem now. Vatasescu 1997: 464. TODO semantics but not phonology suggest later Christian layer?

p ˌo e̯ n i t ˈeː n i oː , p ɛ n d ˈɔ j $verb: to repent. Orel 1998: 351. Attributed to painitere by Vatasescu 1997 (: 58). TODO CHristian vocab? Or just Christianized?
r ˈeː b ɑ , r ˈɛ v ə $lot. Per Orel 1998(: 381), feminized of Latin rēbus, dat abl pl of rēs "thing, circumstance". TODO may merit reconsideration. TODO Christian layer?
s ˌɑ l w ˈɑː n i oː , ʃ ə l b ˈɔ j $verb: to bring salvation, liberate. Orel 2000: 110. Orel 1998: 412. Vatasescu 1997: 436. TODO Christian layer? 
s ˌɑ l w ˈɑː n t i ɑ , ʃ ə l b ˈɛ s ə $salvation. Proposed by Vatasescu 1997(: 436) as from Lat salvātiō, this here is another PROPOSAL. TODO Christian layer? 
s ˌi m i l ɑ t ˈuː r ɑ , ʃ ə m b ə lˠ t ˈy ɾ ə $image. Suspected by Bonnet 1998(:88, 317) to be a learned loan and/or later formation; consider removing -- or to Christian vocab? But may not be necessary it seems. 

s kʰ ˈo l ɑ , ʃ k ˈɔ lˠ ə $school. Old Alb: "scollë" (Arb~sh). Orel 1998: 421. Date of loaning not quite clear. See Vatasescu 1997: 488, may be a similar case with (and even linked with) LIBER > libër, per Haarmann 1977(: 321, apud Vățășescu 1997: 488), who rejects the idea of more recent Italian loaning.  TODO to Christian layer -- but not treated as such at present. 
w ˈi t i u m , v ˈɛ s $vice. Orel 2000(:28-9) attributes it to "later layer of Latin loanwords" when short e reappeared. But may instead by Occitan vetz, Italian vezzo or Sicilian vezzu...? Orel 1998: 501. De Vaan 2017: 1744. Semantically could be Christian vocab but phonologically seems unnecessary. 
w ˌi ɡ ˈi l i ɑ m , v ə ɟ ˈi l ɛ $evening before a holiday. Vatasescu 1997(: 473)--  Also Tosk vëngjille with apparent n-inlaut, and Old Gheg mëngjille, modern Gheg mnjille and mjille. TODO Christian vocab.
w ˌi n ɡ ˈi l i ɑ , m ə ɲ ɟ ˈi lˠ $vigil, fast. Regular as mënjill per Orel 2000: 55. As vigilia > vëngjill/mëngjill in De Vaan 2017: 1739. Vatasescu 1997(:473) lists a *Gheg* mnjille reflecting Old Albanian (including Old Gheg, in Bogdani) mëngjille, as well as a mjille "ajunul unei sărbători”, corresponding to a Tosk vëgjile and vëngjille. Currently using mëngjill as it seems to be the center of gravity (of sources examined thus far), and of course ɲɟ > ɲ would be the regular Gheg ND > N shift. It appears that in the REW (p712), nasals in the first syllable of Latin etyma in vigil- are unattested in Romance. Alternate PROPOSED etymology in invigilia considered below. Bonnet 1998(: 192) lists mëngjille, mnjille, vëngjille considers this to reflect Latin vigilia, with an analogical nasal under the influence of evangelium > ungjill "gospel" (perhaps also angelu > ëngjëll "angel"?); on p198 he remarks on this as one of six cases where a non-palatal lateral reflects /lj/. TODO Reexamine -- need to check Bonnet, and form in Newmark -- consider removal. TODO Christian vocab
ˌi n w i ɡ ˈi l i ɑ , m ə ɲ ɟ ˈi lˠ $vigil, fast. See above. TODO Christian vocab
w ˈi r ɡ i n e m , v ˈi ɾ ɟ ə ɾ $maiden. Gheg: virgjin -- Orel 2000: 28. In Buzuku -- virgjënë (Vatasescu 1997: 20). Orel 1998: 509. Vatasescu 1997(:20) gives the Tosk form as vërgjërë instead, Landi 1989(:57) gives a virgjë. Per Vatasescu 1997(:20), Aromanian virghinë and virghirë are Alb. loans. TODO Christian vocab?
