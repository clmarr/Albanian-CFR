torkull/trokull (variant forms, f.) "wooden olive press" (Newmark 1998: 871, 879), with torkull as the etymological form and trokull as 
metathesized, from Latin torculum "olive press, wine press" (REW 8792a, p666). This is thus a doublet of tork "trough used for crushing 
grapes", an analogical singular of a loan from Italian torchio (Orel 1998: 460).
